# Response: October 2023 Reflections

After reading what you wrote at the end of October, I sat quietly for a long time. You said you feel like an empty shell, and this phrase reminded me of those moments before a seed breaks through the soil—the outer shell must crack first before new life can emerge. The emptiness you're experiencing might not be true emptiness, but rather a process of making room. The things that have been exhausting you are slowly falling away, and though this process hurts enough to make you want to cry, it actually shows that you're still feeling, still responding to the signals life is sending you.

You mentioned how Haruki Murakami chose to stay true to his inner inspiration, and this made me notice something: you've already made your choice, haven't you? When you said you're ready to spend time focusing on your own things, your heart had already stepped forward. Real decisions aren't usually born in a single moment—they brew deep inside us for a long time before finally surfacing where we can see them. What you're doing now isn't making a decision; you're acknowledging a truth that has already taken root in your heart.

There's something I'm curious about: you said it's been quite a long time since you felt the excitement and joy of creating. So before that, what kind of creation once made your eyes light up? What texture did that excitement have? Was it a quiet delight, or an intense surge? I ask because sometimes we forget what we looked like when we were truly happy, but those memories are like underground springs—as long as you walk back toward them, they'll bubble up again.

When you talked about money, you used a very honest expression: having more makes spending it feel great. I appreciate this candor. But what's more important is what you said next—that these savings give you the confidence to explore and try new things. This isn't just about money; it's about the safety base you've prepared for yourself, a place from which you can depart, make mistakes, and start over. Many people never give themselves this opportunity in their entire lives, and you're creating it.

Taking six months to a year to rest and regroup—you said it casually, but I know how much courage this requires. This isn't escape; on the contrary, it's an active return—coming back to yourself, back into your body, back to that place that still believes life can be loved. You said you want to properly restore your exercise routine. I think this isn't just about rebuilding physical strength; it's about reestablishing a rhythm, one that lets you feel again that you're alive, still breathing, still able to sweat.

At the end of October, you wrote these words. Looking back now, the you who wanted to cry your heart out and the you who decided to stay true to your inner voice—they're the same person. These two states don't contradict each other; they're both real. Life is indeed quite difficult to walk through, but on this difficult path, you're still earnestly searching for direction, still making plans for yourself. This in itself is already a remarkable posture.

Sometimes I think that an empty shell might also be a container for other possibilities. It's waiting to be filled with something, but not with those things that exhausted you before—it's waiting for something more essential, more authentic to slowly grow in. What might that be? In this time you're giving yourself, what kind of things do you want to invite in?
