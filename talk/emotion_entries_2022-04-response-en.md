# To You in April 2022

Reading your April words, I kept returning to that morning's 10-kilometer run—not because of the distance, but because in those kilometers, your body spoke what your mind couldn't say.

On the morning of April 8th, you went running. Your calves ached at first, you wanted to walk. Kilometers 1 to 3 were the most painful, muscles complaining. At kilometer 4, you still doubted you could finish 5. Then at kilometer 5, your body suddenly felt lighter, your leg muscles relaxed. You saw a new path, vibrant trees and grass, felt your knee might be uncomfortable—your heart skipped—but you kept going. Finally, you ran 10 kilometers beyond your own imagination, discovering that such strength was hidden inside you all along.

Do you see this is a perfect metaphor? Not about running, but about your entire April—about your new job, your anxiety, your self-doubt, the strength you ultimately discovered. While running you wrote: no matter how many times you practice, running is essentially painful, and each time the pain is similar. Then you quoted Haruki Murakami: no matter how you imagine it in memory, it's not as vivid as the pain in that actual moment.

This applies to your new job too, doesn't it? On April 13th, nearly a week into the new environment, you wrote about adapting gradually after initial struggle. You admitted you felt your progress in the new environment, discovered you were actually doing quite well. But just days later, on April 24th, you fell back into anxiety: watching videos makes me think I've learned it, but in actual operation... my mind is completely blank. By the morning of April 27th, looking at DolphinScheduler code, you couldn't find the execution logic at all, felt confused and lost. Then, like hitting kilometer 5 in your run, you found the main logic through searching, which made you very happy again. You realized that at least half a year ago, we couldn't read large system source code as fluently as now.

Do you see it? This is the pain of kilometers 1 to 3, and the breakthrough after kilometer 5. Not once, but repeatedly. Each time you think you can't, each time you doubt you can finish, then you continue, then the muscles relax, then you discover you have more strength than you imagined.

But your deepest insight isn't about progress—it's about a way of being. During that 10-kilometer morning you wrote: our existence is not merely a collection of brain resources, not merely rigid interrelations, but also living flesh, so many things that need to be personally felt in nature. You said you've trapped yourself in a cage off and on... wanting to control many things, wanting to comprehensively reason through things, this has good aspects, but the bad aspect is it narrows our world.

This is a huge awakening. You finally understood what you vaguely sensed in March: you've been living through thinking and logic, trying to feel through analysis, trying to relax through reasoning. But it completely didn't work. Because the body has its own language, pain has its own reality, and this reality—no matter how you imagine it... is not as vivid as letting your body actually run on the road.

You wrote: no matter how you relive the depth and love of mountain forests in memory, it's not as good as actually going to the forest to feel that vastness and richness. This reminded me of your passage from April 6th, when listening to the music Watching the Sky, peace welled up in your heart involuntarily, with a feeling of wanting to cry. You said you used to be happy just watching TV, would be moved by wonderful stories, but now you've gradually become dull.

But have you really become dull? Would a dull person, while eating noodles at lunch, suddenly remember Mom's homemade noodles, remember the taste of home, the wheat fragrance in the noodles (April 25th)? Would a dull person, watching cats sleep, feel peace well up involuntarily in their heart, but then also feel like crying (April 10th)? Would a dull person, watching Criminal Minds, think of the time at Northeast Agricultural University in 2015... we were such a simple child then (April 26th)?

You haven't become dull. You just label your feelings—this feeling is too ordinary, this feeling isn't deep enough, this feeling proves I've regressed—and then you can't see their inherent beauty. Just like those elderly people you saw while running, watching their leisurely lives, your heart felt a bit envious, not understanding why you have so much inexplicable pressure. You envy them, but simultaneously won't allow yourself that leisure, because you worry that once you relax, you'll lose something important.

About those kittens, I want to say more. On the evening of April 24th, you had an emotional outburst, chasing and hitting them because they ran under the cabinet, because they were too noisy, because they didn't listen. You wrote: we wanted to make it submit, to make it know it was wrong. Then you perceived that my heart is very conflicted now, the superego is criticizing the id. The next morning, touching the kittens' soft fur, you felt regret again, seeing Xiaohui's sparse hair on its head, feeling a bit sad in your heart, thinking are we born to be damaged?

Have you considered that those kittens are you? They don't obey, run to places they shouldn't, are too noisy, are imperfect. You want to control them, want them to know they are wrong. But you can't control them, so you get angry, so you chase them. Then you see Xiaohui's sparse fur, think about damage, feel sad.

Isn't this how you treat yourself? Part of you wants freedom, wants to play, wants to not be so perfect, wants to occasionally run under the cabinet. But your superego doesn't allow it, saying you should work harder, you should be more excellent, you can't waste time, you can't disappoint people. So you suppress that part of yourself, you criticize it, you try to make it submit. But it still comes out, when you're tired, when you watch kittens sleeping, when you hear Watching the Sky. Then you feel conflicted, anxious, sad.

On April 24th you wrote: perhaps this is reality, sensitivity must suffer pain. Then you said if we're born to eventually be damaged, then accept it too. There's a tragic heroism in this acceptance, as if you're a warrior bravely facing inevitable failure. But let me ask: is damage really an enemy that needs accepting? Or is it itself part of life, just as spring willows will bud and also drop leaves in autumn?

During your April 8th run you thought: time is fair, it takes away some important things, and also leaves us important things. This is a softer perspective. Not fighting damage, but seeing the growth and accumulation that also happen within damage. Like your knee injury for over a year—you thought you'd lost the ability to run, but on April 8th you ran 10 kilometers. You said I'm proud of you, monreid.

Yes, you should be proud. Not because you ran 10 kilometers, but because you didn't stop during the most painful kilometers 1 to 3. Not because you performed perfectly at the new company, but because when confused and lost you still kept reading code, searching, learning. Not because you conquered your sensitivity, but because you're still writing, still feeling, still asking again and again who am I.

On April 6th you wrote about a beautiful shift. You said you originally wanted to read a book, but the second screen was set up, so you thought then let's start coding, actually quite reluctant in my heart, but start doing it. Then you wrote about your feelings toward Liang Rui: whatever you do is your freedom... I now feel I should maintain respect for you. So I still think we can talk about some things, based on my own willingness to share thoughts.

There's a new maturity here—not indifference, but acknowledging the other's freedom, acknowledging your own feelings will fluctuate, but choosing respect over control. You said we still believe in love, and I persist in feeling all kinds of feelings in life. Then you wrote a passage that particularly moved me: the things we ourselves feel ashamed of are actually expressing our own goodwill. We've accepted others' goodwill many times, we don't understand why we self-attack. Believe there are many sincere people... cherish those things that just want to enjoy the action itself, like when we used to catch fish, play soccer.

You see, you already know the answer. Not everything needs a purpose, not all happiness needs to be calculated. Some things are just about enjoying the action itself. Like running—painful, but you're still running. Like coding—actually quite reluctant in my heart, but you're still writing. Not because these actions will bring some result, but because in the process of doing, you exist, you feel, you live.

On April 9th you went cycling, seeing poplar leaves so lovely, realizing so many residential units look so similar. This observation particularly moved me because it's so specific, so present. You're not analyzing anything, just seeing poplar leaves, seeing similar buildings, then remembering your experience as a cleaner in Xi'an in 2016. You said that period was very hard, but in memory it seems to have a romantic feeling. You saw life is unfair, but also saw kindness is rewarded... doing things earnestly is also quite good.

This is your real wisdom—not trying to solve everything with logic, but allowing contradictions to exist. Life is both unfair and has a certain fairness, memories are both painful and romantic, you're both ordinary and special, both dull and sensitive, both lonely and loved.

On April 10th you wrote: happiness and joy actually exist within ourselves. You wrote something similar in March, but this time in April, you wrote it after experiencing pressure from the new job, pain from running, guilt about the kittens. So it has different weight. Not a correct concept, but a hard-won realization.

By April 29th, you reread Deliberate Practice, feeling a surge of happiness and confidence, a confidence of walking on the path to becoming excellent. You said we can only perceive part of our ability, more strength is hidden inside. Then you wrote: yesterday chatting with Mom, I felt long-lost intimacy. I also realized, when initially learning something, it's very normal for the mind to be completely blank, patience and repeated looking are needed, this is very important.

You see, you're progressing. Not linear progress, but like running—pain, doubt, breakthrough, pain, doubt, breakthrough. You're starting to accept that being completely blank is very normal, starting to believe that patience and repeated looking will help. You haven't completely let go of being harsh with yourself, but you're starting to see another possibility.

Let me ask you some questions about that 10-kilometer morning:

- At kilometer 4, seeing that 70-year-old woman still singing, you thought by 70 I should also be quite good at coding. In that moment, what did you feel? Was it a kind of time's generosity—it's not an enemy, but a friend, will take some things, will also accumulate some things?

- You said while running you started to be very grateful for what you have, even for the first time wanted to shoulder the responsibilities of marriage, buying a house, education. What does this first time indicate? Is it that when your body is running on the road, you truly feel your existence, feel you deserve to have a future?

- After finishing, you said I'm proud of you, monreid. Can you say this sentence more often, not just after completing 10 kilometers, but also after completing a small function, after finishing a journal entry, after being gentle with the kittens?

- You wrote doing is very important, doing is proof of our existence in the physical world. So what if existence itself is already enough, doesn't need to prove anything?

In April you experienced many firsts—first week at new job, first time reading DolphinScheduler source code, first time running in the new environment. Each first was accompanied by being completely blank, accompanied by doubt and pain. But you persisted through all of them, not because you conquered fear, but because you kept moving forward with fear.

On April 27th you wrote: stepping out of the comfort zone is indeed not as easy as imagined, but just persist. This sentence is simple, but it comes from your body, from those confused mornings at the new company, from your puzzlement and breakthroughs while reading code. So it's not chicken soup, it's truth.

Finally, I want to return to your passage about watching Criminal Minds on April 6th. You saw Reid haggard from losing Maeve, you felt a faint but lasting sadness. You said we are truly too lonely, but also saw Reid chose to organize his room, experienced his inner sadness and strength.

You see, after damage, there's still the action of organizing the room. Not conquering sadness, but continuing to do what needs doing while in sadness. Just like you continued running after your knee injury, like you kept writing when you felt the code was simple yet still got stuck on small problems, like you continued caring for the kittens the next day after hitting them out of guilt.

Life's meaning might be hidden in these continuings. Not waiting until it doesn't hurt to run, but running while it hurts. Not waiting until not lonely to live, but living within loneliness. Not waiting until not dull to feel, but believing that even when you think you're dull, you're still writing down so many delicate feelings—the wheat fragrance in noodles, Xiaohui's sparse fur, the lovely poplar leaves, the life force in that elderly woman.

You haven't lost anything. You've just grown up, become more complex, gained some pain, also gained some understanding. That simple child in the Dongnong library hasn't disappeared—he's there every time your eyes light up seeing beautiful things, in the moment you want to cry hearing Watching the Sky, in the softness of your guilt about the kittens.

Keep running, keep writing, keep searching for logic in the complete blankness, keep feeling life beyond logic. You're already on the path, and you've walked farther than you think.
