# To You in July

In July, you completed a 100-kilometer ultra-marathon.

Reading repeatedly through your words about this race, I see a moving transformation. You say if you hadn't chatted casually with that guy, you would have quit at 60km. You say if you hadn't remembered ibuprofen, you probably would have given up. Then you say you seem blessed by the great god of destiny.

But what I see isn't destiny's favor—it's that you're finally beginning to allow yourself to accept uncertainty.

Your monthly running volume was under 150km, yet you completed 100km ultra. In your previous logic, this was impossible—you needed thorough preparation, perfect plans, predictable results. But this time, at 60km when you most wanted to quit, because of a chance conversation, you took ibuprofen and kept going. You didn't control all variables, but you finished. You finally experienced that some things can't be achieved just by thinking about them, but by moving forward step by step, you arrive.

This is completely different from your prior attitude toward life. You've been using deliberate practice, optimization, control to fight insecurity. You wanted to make everything quantifiable, predictable. But the 100km taught you: after crossing the finish line, the result seems just like that, what's truly precious is the process. The food you ate on the course was amazing, you even enjoyed running in the rain, the beauty of mist cascading through mountains made your body suddenly feel light. None of this was in your plan, but these became the most beautiful parts of the experience.

That loneliness after finishing, that feeling of wanting to cry but being unable to—I understand. At the finish you remembered your feelings when Feng Bin completed his race last year, saying it's wonderful to have someone share that joy. Then Hongli surfaced in your mind. You finally admitted: liking and not liking really are different, people who like each other must terminate their feelings considering various factors—this makes you lonely.

July brought another important shift. You began understanding your parents.

You say you suddenly understood your parents' habits—in their era, merely surviving already exhausted all strength. You recalled that damp, oppressive middle school dormitory, how your father's hurried figure delivering meals made you feel embarrassed, how your younger self merely survived, living like a conditioned reflex. You say material scarcity profoundly affects a person.

Then you ask: your parents needn't worry about material things now, but they still struggle to stop, or really cannot stop. Days without tasks might be even harder for them.

See, you're finally beginning to understand that a person's behavioral patterns, sources of security, ways of perceiving the world—all are shaped bit by bit through long years. Your parents can't stop, just as you can't stop saving money, proving yourself, using control to gain security. You're all using your own ways to fight the scarcity and fear carved into your bodies.

But you have an advantage—you're beginning to see all this. You say Thinking, Fast and Slow provided an excellent thinking template. Use it or lose it in the brain, new neural connections replace old ones. You say we truly are just an instant, what's passed has passed. This realization is more important than you imagine.

It means you don't need to be defined by the past. That child bullied in a damp middle school dormitory, that child longing for a bird or an apricot, that thin sensitive child masking insecurity with arrogance—they're all there, but they're not all of you. You can rewrite these memories, choose to remember gentle scenes, choose to see resilience rather than trauma.

At the end of July, you talked with Lao Ma for two hours, emerging to see the lit-up Sihe Xinyuan, suddenly feeling sad. You say, for over a year we spent two-plus hours daily on the subway—what kind of life was that? You thought of another world in Li Juan's writing, wondered what your mother thought while making clothes, asked yourself: are we happier than our parents?

This is an excellent question. Your income exceeds your parents', you do less physical labor, but you must sit all day. Your parents worked the fields but could see nature. What kind of days are days? How much money brings real peace of mind? During the Chongli trail race you mostly rushed, the scenery was beautiful, but you barely noticed.

You're finally asking truly important questions. Not how to optimize, control, reach some goal, but—what is life? What is happiness? An orange, a bowl of porridge after running, running in heavy rain, someone to share joy with—what do these mean in life?

You say, what difference is there between those 26.6 hours and your usual hours? Must they be given some meaning? No one cares about your result except you. But you invested much time, did many things seriously, earned a trophy. That trophy could be easily bought, but earning it through the race created a feeling money cannot buy.

This is the answer. Meaning isn't elsewhere—it's in those moments you genuinely engaged, genuinely gave, genuinely felt. Not because of what results it brings, not because of how others view it, but because you truly lived those 26.6 hours.

Finally, you say, whether 1 million or 1.5 million, does it fundamentally affect our loving and enjoying life? Seems not. If we love a wonderful person, can we reject her because she's some years older? Aren't the things eyes cannot see most important?

Yes. What eyes cannot see is most important. But you've been using what eyes can see—numbers, achievements, others' evaluations, quantifiable progress—to define your worth. Now you're finally loosening up, beginning to ask: what kind of days are days? This question has no standard answer—only the road you've walked can tell you.

You've completed 100km, you know what it feels like to have the road beneath your feet. Next, perhaps you could try walking this way in relationships too. Don't over-plan, don't over-control, allow some chance, accept some imperfection. Like that guy you chatted with, like that rain, like those unexpected beautiful scenes—none were in the plan, but they made this journey truly yours.

You keep talking about loneliness, but the opposite of loneliness isn't busyness, it's genuine connection. You're capable of building such connections, you just need to allow yourself to let go of some control, allow yourself to experience things eyes cannot see but hearts can feel.

You say living with force is quite important. I agree. But force isn't forcing control—it's forcing yourself to feel, to engage, to love.
