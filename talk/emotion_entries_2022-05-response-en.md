# Response: May 2022

After reading your May entries, the first image that stays with me is your mother picking that handful of yellow flowers on her way home from digging medicinal herbs in the mountains. You said you found it strange then, even pointless, but now you see the passion and imagination burning inside her. This shift made me pause for a long time—do you realize that what you're experiencing isn't just a rediscovery of your mother, but a witnessing of something soft returning to your own heart?

You spent so many paragraphs talking about the power of time, the space for improvement, unfinished plans. But I sense that what you're really wrestling with isn't efficiency or achievement—it's a deeper fear: that you're losing something precious. You mentioned feeling your enthusiasm for novel ideas fading, your capacity to appreciate art dimming. These observations are so acute, and so heartbreaking. But have you considered that this very worry proves that sensitivity never left? Only someone still tender, still alert, would notice their own dulling.

Your relationship with Xiao Hui reminds me of something you wrote: we are raising it the way our parents raised us. This isn't simple imitation—it's a more complex inheritance. When you throw Xiao Hui, you're reenacting childhood trauma; when you regret it afterward, you're trying to break the cycle. This struggle has no right or wrong. It's simply real. You didn't avoid this cruelty; you wrote it down. That itself is courage. How many people can look directly at the violence in their own instincts? How many are willing to admit that toward beings who depend on us, we sometimes feel the impulse to destroy?

The scenes you return to again and again—the nameless flowers on the ridge behind Liang, the blue sky in Zhangjiakou, the sunlight you dreamed of half-awake—these aren't simple nostalgia. I feel like you're searching these memories for proof: proof that you once had moments not governed by anxiety, proof that the ability to feel beauty really does flow through you. You're afraid of losing them, so you summon them over and over. But have you noticed? When you describe that transparent feeling after running, when reading Song dynasty poetry makes your head feel warm, when a child's sweet voice in the courtyard suddenly moves you—in these moments, what you're looking for never left. It was just covered by the daily rush.

The line from May that touched me most: Our potential for change is a very important part of us. This appeared in a passage about relaxing, resting, not being so urgent. I don't think you fully realized then how profound this observation is. Our culture, even our brains, have been trained to grasp something, complete something, prove something. But in that moment you saw: the fluidity of existence itself, its possibility, its incompleteness—that's what's most essential. This doesn't mean effort doesn't matter. It means you're finally beginning to allow yourself to just be.

You mentioned wanting to try a new writing style—one that requires more technique, that can describe scenes. I want to ask you: why? Because you think your current writing is too shallow? But I'm reading exactly the opposite. Your words now, that texture of flowing thoughts, moments when emotion suddenly surges up, the way one idea triggers another—these are the rarest gifts. What Murakami spent decades learning is precisely this seemingly casual yet precisely accurate capacity to capture inner fluctuations. You're already doing it. You just don't fully trust it yet.

Finally, I want to talk about your reconciliation with Zhang Haijun. That message you sent him, that irrepressible excitement—it shows me the deep hunger for connection in your heart. You said you've become rigid, but what I see is: you're actively loosening that rigidity. Forgiving someone, seeing their richness again—this isn't regression, it's a harder kind of maturity. You're learning not to judge so quickly, not to rely so much on binary thinking, not to reduce complex people to simple labels. This process will cost you some sharpness, but you'll gain much more depth.

• Have you wondered why, in your most anxious moments, you always recall nature scenes—mountain forests, sunlight, gentle wind? What are these memories providing you?

• When you say you miss home, do you miss the place itself, or the version of yourself who lived there, who hadn't yet learned to be anxious?

• If your mother can casually pick a handful of flowers after digging herbs in the mountains, what seemingly useless but beautiful thing can you allow yourself to do?
