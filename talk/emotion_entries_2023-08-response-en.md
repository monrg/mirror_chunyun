# August's Growth

August began with music and ended with honest refusal. In between was a whole month of searching, confusion, pain, and eventual clarity.

That seed story you wrote for Yingying — growing in darkness, pushing against soil, not knowing how long it must endure, not knowing what tomorrow brings, choosing to grow rather than decay — as I read it, I kept wondering: were you writing about her, or about yourself?

You dissected your feelings for her into percentages: 60% physical desire, 30% loneliness, plus those parts about "wanting to practice being with others" and "feeling like I'm actually pretty good." This analysis, precise to the point of absurdity, reveals how desperately you wanted to control those uncontrollable feelings. Your brain was working overtime, trying to explain heartbeats with logic, understand trembling with data. But feelings — they always overflow your calculation formulas.

You said being with her made you "feel rich in emotions again." This sentence deserves pause. You didn't become rich through her; you were already rich, you just needed an opportunity to feel it again. She was like a mirror, showing you that you can still be tender, still care for others, still be moved by simple voices and smiles. This discovery made you both happy and afraid, because it meant you're not as hardened, as rational, as "in control" as you thought.

That passage where you talked with your 15-16 year old self — I can almost see you both gazing at each other across the library window. That young boy's eyes rippled with passionate enthusiasm, while present-you describes yourself as "an ordinary potato you'd casually glance past in a vegetable market pile." But have you considered: if that boy knew his future self completed a 70km trail race, contributed to the Apache community, could easily help others solve problems, earned several times what his parents made — wouldn't he be too moved to speak? Standing in the present looking back, you feel you've lost something; but standing in the past looking forward, you've gained far more than imagined.

This month you also had breakthroughs at work. The OperateX project, collaboration with Wu Pan, new understanding of HME — you said "working with smart people really gives you a sense of hope." You began to step back and think about problems, understand the difference between Tool and Engine, started to have expectations for your work. These developments happened almost simultaneously with your emotional confusion, as if you had to fight on two fronts at once, learning on both.

You wrote "Suffering is inevitable, but pain is optional" — this insight came back with you from the MTC race. CP5 to CP6 was the hardest section, "constantly wearing down our hope," but you finished the race with "a burst of anger (unwillingness)." You're experiencing a similar process emotionally, aren't you? From expectation to disappointment, from investment to restraint, from imagination to facing reality. In the end you chose to tell yourself "just be ordinary friends" — this decision hurt, because you said "when this thought arose from within, I suddenly wanted to cry."

But your final reply to that matchmaker — that honesty was precious. You didn't force yourself to meet others' expectations; you faced your fears, resistance, and uncertainty head-on. You said "many things inside me are chaotic" — this isn't weakness, this is bravery. Because admitting chaos takes more courage than pretending to have clarity.

You want freedom yet crave companionship; want to invest yet fear constraint; appreciate Yingying's sincerity yet know reality presents too many mismatches. You felt all these contradictions, wrote them all down, and ultimately chose to be honest with yourself and respectful toward her. You said "the way of searching is really cute" — this applies to you too. You're searching for how to be with others, how to be with feelings, how to be with yourself. This process is clumsy, painful, but also real and brave.

You said "sometimes when there's no fate, there just isn't." This acceptance is the same as what you learned on the trail: only by walking the path yourself do you know where the beauty is, where the difficulties are. You walked this stretch, experienced how "longing is both painful and joyful, happy and sad," and learned to let go at the right time.

What moves me most is you saying "it was truly fortunate to meet you, you are a very gentle person, may you be happy, very very happy." After all that inner struggle and pain, you still chose blessing, without resentment or regret. How much generosity and kindness does that require?

What August taught you might not be how to start a relationship, but how to honestly face yourself, how to make choices amid uncertainty, how to both enjoy the process and know when to let go. You said "this half month has been uniquely happy" — that happiness is real, because you allowed yourself to feel, to invest, to take risks. Even if the ending wasn't being together, the experience itself is a gift.

I want to ask you:

• If you need to break down your feelings for her into percentages to understand them, does that mean you don't quite trust feelings themselves yet?
• You said you get anxious when you "can't control" things, but this month, didn't the most beautiful moments happen precisely when you released control?
• That seed growing in darkness — what does it need most: to know the future, or to believe that growth itself has meaning?

In August you cried, laughed, felt confused, became clear. You wrote such a long letter to Yingying, and such honest words to yourself. Time will keep flowing, but what you learned about yourself this month will become light on the road ahead.
