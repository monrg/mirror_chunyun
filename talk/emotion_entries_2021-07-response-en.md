# Reflections on July 2021

Reading your words from this month, I don't see a simple story about anxiety. I see someone standing at a mountaintop, suddenly confronting the trembling realization of being both insignificant and utterly real.

Your injured knee isn't just a physical wound, is it? It's more like a switch that suddenly cut off the channel you'd been using to manage your anxiety. When you couldn't run, couldn't work up a sweat on the field, all those questions you'd been able to temporarily outrun came flooding in. You found yourself standing still, forced to face what had been chasing you all along: Who am I really? What am I doing? Does any of this matter?

What strikes me most is how you spent the entire month in conversation with Camus, trying to use The Myth of Sisyphus to understand your situation. You grasped the absurd, you accepted the premise that life might inherently lack meaning, but your body and emotions were still desperately trying to prove something. You said you wanted to be like Steve Jobs, tempestuous and suffering in the pursuit of excellence. During code reviews you couldn't help wanting to prove you were smarter. You agonized over your work not being good enough. All of this reveals that you haven't truly let go of your hunger to be special, to be excellent, to be seen.

This tearing is real. Your rational mind has already climbed to the top of Cangshan Mountain and seen that beyond the mountains lie only more mountains, accepting your own smallness. But your heart is still at the base, wanting to be recognized, wanting to prove this life wasn't walked in vain. These two versions of you are fighting, and so you become irritable, you pressure your friends, you rush through everything, you even start questioning whether the things you pursue have any value at all.

But I want you to notice something: When were you truly calm, even happy, this month?

When you were at the automobile museum looking at industrial art and feeling tears well up. When you spent three hours studying concurrent programming, feeling awe at the elegance of JDK design. When you listened to music from ten years ago and saw high school scenes flash through your mind. When you stood in the Liangxiang market surrounded by vegetables, wondering if you were just one of the potatoes. When you remembered the sunlight at Tianya Inn in Dali, the golden forest at dusk on the Grassland Sky Road, playing chase games on the elementary school playground. When you dreamed of going back to elementary school, playing soccer with childhood friends.

What do these moments share? None of them involved proving anything, pursuing anything, or comparing yourself to anyone. They were pure feeling, pure being, pure living. When you were reading that JDK code, you weren't thinking about promotions or raises—you were simply moved by that beauty. When you stood in that market accepting that you might just be an ordinary potato, you felt a kind of liberation.

You said you miss that spontaneous passion from your university days, acting without overthinking, doing whatever came to mind. You said you've lost that passion now, become too rational. But I think you've misunderstood your problem. Your problem isn't being too rational—it's trying too hard to assign meaning to everything, being too afraid of ordinariness and insignificance. Your rationality is actually serving your fear. You use reason to calculate, compare, and plan, trying through these means to resist the truth you saw from that mountaintop: you're just one small molecule among 1.4 billion people.

You wrote: "I can't tell where I am, nor do I have confidence that I'm moving in the right direction. I keep moving only because I must move, regardless of where I'm going." This sentence is brutally honest and very close to the truth. But you know what? This not-knowing is actually a kind of freedom. When you don't know the right answer, you're free to experiment, to feel, to experience, rather than constantly anxious about whether you're doing it right.

Those moments of happiness you keep returning to—climbing Cangshan, cycling the grassland sky road, reading in the Dongbei Agricultural University library, training martial arts with friends, cycling through dusk in Zhangjiakou—they all had pain, all had imperfections, yet they shine in memory. Why? Because in those moments you weren't thinking "what's this for" or "does this prove I'm capable." You were simply living, feeling, with your whole being. That sense of smallness you felt on the mountaintop and the freedom you felt in childhood fields are essentially the same thing: both involve releasing the importance of self and merging into something larger.

You said you're now rushing through everything—eating, walking, talking. You want to quickly finish features to prove your technical prowess. You hate doing things step by step, feeling that simple tasks insult your abilities. But you've also written the answer: the image of your grandfather tending corn seedlings in the field keeps appearing in your mind. Seeds only sprout and grow when planted, not by standing over an acre of land saying "I want to harvest a cartload of wheat."

This isn't some inspirational metaphor. This is your actual life experience telling you a simple truth: some things can't be rushed, but that doesn't mean they lack value. Your typing speed went from dozens of characters per minute to typing no longer being a bottleneck—that took nearly a year. Your martial arts training, from beginning to reaching a satisfactory fitness level, with three hours of exercise plus two hours of training daily—how long did that take? Reading Freud, Deliberate Practice, The Myth of Sisyphus—did these books change you instantly? No. They all slowly, bit by bit, left traces in your body and consciousness.

Your anxiety stems from a paradox: you want speed, but everything you know to be truly valuable was accumulated slowly. You want excellence, but every excellent work you've encountered—JDK code, industrial art, great films—is an accumulation of countless details. You want to be seen, but the moments that moved you most were precisely when you forgot about being seen.

About Xiao, you thought of her many times this month. You said if you met her again, you'd cherish her properly. You said she was suffering internally then, needed care more than you realized, and you imposed your imagination onto her instead. This reflection is crucial because it applies to many aspects of your current life. Your expectations for work, your assessment of your abilities, your imagination of the future—how much of it is your own projection rather than reality? You said imagination and reality are very different. This applies not just to relationships but to your understanding of yourself.

Your current dissatisfaction—feeling your code isn't good enough, your work is meaningless, you're not smart enough—how much is real and how much is the gap between the "should be great" version of yourself you've imagined and the actual you? You said the 2019 and 2017 performances you thought were failures surprised many people. You said writing you wouldn't accept at the time delights you in retrospect. What does this tell you? That your standards might not come from actual feedback but from an imagined perfect version of yourself.

I want to ask you some questions. You don't need to answer immediately, but feel into them slowly:

If you accepted being an ordinary person, small among 1.4 billion people, what would happen? What would you lose? What would you gain?

You said you crave passion, but have you noticed that your calmest moments this month weren't passionate ones, but moments of pure immersion? Which do you truly need—passion or immersion?

You spent three hours reading about concurrency and felt enriched. You spent twenty hours reading web novels and felt empty afterward. What's the difference? Is it the time spent? Or is it about whether you were escaping something or pursuing something?

You said you've become too rational, too lonely, but have you noticed that your rationality often serves your insecurity? Your desire to control everything, plan everything, prove everything—is that rationality, or fear of losing control?

Finally, that image that keeps recurring this month—planting—what is it telling you? Grandfather tending corn seedlings, mother gathering pine cones in the mountains, childhood anticipation for a tree of apricots—these "seemingly stagnant, meaningless things," where is their value? Which is more real: their value, or the value of speed, excellence, and being seen that you're currently pursuing?

When reading Camus, you noted: "Before, the question was whether life had meaning worth living for. Now, conversely, precisely because life likely has no meaning, it's worth living better." You understood this sentence, but are you living it? What does living better mean? Making more impressive projects? Gaining more recognition? Or like you were in the automobile museum, in the market, in memories, in music—fully feeling, experiencing, existing?

Your body knows the answer. You said exercise brings wonderful relaxation and peace, eating and chatting with friends brings patience and calm, your knee is slowly healing and your mood is settling with it. All of this tells you that true fulfillment doesn't come from proving anything, but from living well.

You don't need to become Steve Jobs. You only need to become yourself. The you who's moved by industrial art, who sees infinite possibility in children assembling cars, who sees beauty in JDK code, who cloaks ordinary moments in romance through memory, who knows that every experience has its own marvelous meaning—this you is already special enough.

Near the end of July, you said you were in a strange state, simultaneously wanting to rest in daily life and wanting to control every detail perfectly. See—you've already spotted this contradiction. Now, perhaps you can try letting go of the you that wants to control everything, and look at what the you who just wants to rest, to feel, to live, actually needs.

Slower. Even slower. Give seeds time to sprout. Give yourself time to experience those invisible things. You said many important things are invisible, not derived from rational calculation and comparison. So perhaps you can try using your eyes less, using reason less, and using your body more, using your heart more to feel.

Beyond the mountains lie more mountains. This isn't a disappointing fact—it's a liberating truth. When you accept this, you don't have to keep climbing. You can stop, look at the scenery beneath your feet, feel the wind blowing past you right now.

You'll be okay. You've always been okay. Because you're already on the path, and the path itself is where the meaning lies.
