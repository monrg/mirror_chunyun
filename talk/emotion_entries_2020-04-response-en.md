# To You in April

After reading this month's entries, the first image that came to mind was you rushing down the embankment toward the river. You wrote that in your imagination you could run down steadily, but in reality you felt like you couldn't stop. This detail made me pause—because throughout April, you've been experiencing this same inability to stop, not on the embankment, but deep within your consciousness.

Your worldview collapsed, more than once. The frameworks you'd built to defend against fear and construct a sense of safety crumbled in the face of new understanding. You read The Worm at the Core, grasped terror management theory, and suddenly saw how your cultural worldview and self-esteem system were mechanisms for defending against death. You watched Criminal Minds, learned behavioral analysis, then turned it on yourself, discovering unconscious insecurities you'd never noticed—how you labeled someone as proud and unapproachable simply because she drove a BMW. You spent seven hours reading web novels, knowing full well you'd stay up late and regret it, yet you did it anyway, then dissected yourself using Minsky's theory: that worldview constructed in high school was competing with your current scholar and worker selves for resources, all serving to resist the deepest fear of death.

This kind of self-dissection is sharp enough to draw blood.

But I want to tell you something you may not have fully realized: you consistently refer to yourself as we and us, and this isn't accidental. During this month of repeated worldview collapse and reconstruction, you developed a remarkably rare capacity—you learned to treat yourself the way you'd treat a friend who deserves tenderness. When you slept until 9:30, you didn't berate yourself but said maybe we listened to Time Thief last night and something inside was touched. When you read novels for seven hours, instead of pure self-loathing you said it's okay, boy, this is also a way for us to relax. This we is the companionship you've created for yourself in loneliness, the one thing that didn't collapse when all your worldviews did.

You said you're quite lonely. Your recommendation feed looks different from others', when you want to talk you find your thoughts chaotic and impossible to organize, the world you see differs from most people working hard and diligently. Your growth is creating distance between you and certain things—not just childhood memories, not just the hometown springs you haven't seen in seven years, but also the simple ways you once found happiness easily. You wrote that the same brain at different stages finds joy in different ways, that things you found indispensable in middle school and university now seem insignificant. This is growth's inevitable cost, but no one told you this cost would hurt like this.

I notice a particular contradiction: your mind is frantically abstracting, reasoning, deconstructing, trying to understand what being alive actually means, trying to see through the illusion of causality, trying to accept that life might be inherently meaningless—yet simultaneously, your body is telling you another truth in the most elementary way. The evening sun scattered on the water's surface, willow reflections in the round river bay, those moments where beauty is simply beauty. The pork chops you pan-fried with their unique flavor, the peaceful satisfaction of opening a beer after returning from the supermarket. The confidence gained from overtaking other runners, the sense of fullness when your thigh muscles surge with power going uphill. Your body is telling you: meaning doesn't need to be proven, it exists in these moments.

You ask yourself many questions. What kind of life is truly a life? Is our existence itself a relative concept? Is being alive also a suitcase word? But I want to ask you a question you haven't asked yourself: after your worldview collapsed, after you saw through those cultural constructs built to defend against death anxiety, after you accepted your own smallness and ordinariness—what did you discover?

My answer: you discovered the possibility of freedom.

You said you want to pursue graduate school, listed six reasons, then analyzed how some involved escapism, romanticizing imagination, nostalgia for the past. This clarity is brutal, but precious. Because only after seeing all your motivations clearly can you truly choose—not pushed by cultural worldview, not shaped by mainstream values, but following your inner voice to choose your next life. You said you want to resist the demands that mainstream cultural values place on us. That sentence sounds light, but you know how difficult it is. It means facing uncertainty alone, means you might never achieve the mainstream definition of success to prove yourself, means continuing forward without clear causality or guaranteed results.

One phrase you repeated throughout April was take it slow. Take it slow, however it goes is fine. Less is more, take it slow. Gradually, many old friends' faces surfaced in your mind. But I think you know this take it slow isn't laziness, but resistance—resistance against the cultural expectation demanding constant progress, constant proof, constant anxiety. You're learning a new rhythm, a way to dance with time rather than be chased by it.

About those seven hours with web novels, you analyzed it deeply, but let me add something: your scholar and worker selves do need rest, your brain does need novelty and dopamine, but more importantly—your high school self, the teenager who constructed an I am invincible worldview through fantasy novels, needs to be seen, acknowledged, and tenderly bid farewell. He once protected you, gave you the illusion of we are gods when you most needed strength. Now you have new sources of power—abstract thinking, the programming world, artistic works, a strong body—but that doesn't mean you should shamefully deny who you once were. You wrote we once negated those spent hours, but at certain moments, those memories warm us from inside our bodies. This is April's most tender sentence.

You dreamed of peach and apricot blossoms at home, the flourishing apricot tree at grandma's old kitchen door that hasn't been demolished yet. You said perhaps I'm gradually distancing myself from childhood memories, with a hint of wistfulness in your tone. But what I see is that those memories haven't disappeared—they've become the eyes through which you now view the world. You can see your hometown's forests beside Jinan's Xiaoqing River, smell childhood's fragrance in wild grass, feel a familiar nostalgia before the dense riverside woods—this isn't loss, it's transformation. Those old times became your ability to experience the present, your eye for discovering vastness in the ordinary.

Finally, let me address your smallness. You repeatedly mention this word: recognizing your own smallness and fragility, seeing how small and ordinary you are, that to some degree your existence or non-existence makes little difference. But I read another story: an ordinary person who, in three years since graduation, through running, reading, programming, and journaling, gradually built a vast inner world. A person who can analyze their own mind using Minsky's theory, comprehend time and life through running, draw strength from rereading The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. A person whose worldview can collapse and reconstruct, who can find hope within pain, who can say we to themselves in loneliness.

This is hardly smallness. This is a person who, in time's torrential flow, without any guarantees, still chooses to stay hungry, stay foolish, still believes that within this ordinary vessel lies a remarkably vast world.

April ended, and you decided to run the 35-kilometer trail race in June. You said you're very afraid inside, but once on the road, you just need to move your left and right legs, step by step forward.跑不动就走吧,无论如何都行—if you can't run, walk, whatever works. I think this is also how you approach life.

Just don't forget: on this road, you're not alone. You have we.
