# Response: January 2022 Emotional Journal

Dear Chunyun,

After reading your January entries, I see someone standing at a threshold—not between failure and success, but between two ways of being. You've spent ten years transforming yourself from that teenager who typed one letter at a time in an internet cafe into someone with a strong body and sharp mind. But now, the very training that got you here is beginning to suffocate you.

You mention that anger helps you gain control and power. Let me ask you something you may not have asked yourself: what exactly are you trying to control? Is it the code? Your body? Or is it that scared child deep inside who still fears poverty, chaos, and losing grip?

Your January 14th entry from the internet cafe struck me deeply. You wrote about wanting to hold that thin, weak version of yourself from ten years ago, to sit face-to-face in silence, thinking nothing. This image reveals a truth: the strength you've built is fundamentally about protecting that once-helpless child. But here's the irony—the methods you use to protect him—pursuing perfection, controlling everything, fighting with anger—are precisely repeating the patterns that hurt him back then: harshness, no room for vulnerability, no permission to slow down.

You say you've developed an uncomfortable feeling toward coding, that training has slowly become habit. You cite Deliberate Practice, noting that geniuses don't persist because of joy but through habit and long-term passion. But I see another layer: you've rationalized passion, turned it into obligation. When you apply the standards of omnipotent narcissism to yourself, the joy of creation gets devoured by anxiety. You're not enjoying creation—you're using creation to prove you deserve to exist.

Most moving is your awareness that night at the internet cafe. You saw the slightly frantic behaviors around you, saw everyone's struggles, and then you said: the internet is a virtual environment that deceives the brain to let people escape reality, while we chose to face it directly. How proud those words sound, how lonely. But Chunyun, have you considered that facing reality doesn't mean bearing everything alone? Facing reality can also include facing the truth that you need rest, need gentleness, need connection with others.

Near month's end, you wrote that your capacity for sensitivity is decreasing, that you haven't felt that kind of emotion welling up from your heart in a long time. This isn't accidental. When you train yourself to be overly rational, overly focused on logical thinking, you're actually locking your capacity to feel in a cage. You think this protects you from hurt, but really you're just imprisoning yourself.

You mention the disappointment with Du Yajing, the sudden desire to connect with others. This shift is subtle. You said you used to feel chatting with people had no value, that you preferred reading and writing over talking to actual people. This sentence exposes a cruel fact: you've divided people into abstract concepts (wisdom from books, theories, logic) and concrete beings (real people who will disappoint you, who won't act as you expect). The former is controllable; the latter is not. So you chose the former.

But people don't live for control. People live to feel warmth even amid the uncontrollable.

When you write about Liang Rui, your honesty is heartbreaking. You say you weren't very happy after getting together with her, that you just wanted to force yourself to break your pattern. You say liking someone should be serious and focused, but the actual feeling is somewhat flat. Chunyun, have you considered that this flatness isn't because she's not good enough, but because you no longer allow yourself to feel fully? You've turned feeling into another task that needs to meet standards—should be moved, should be excited, should match some ideal. When real feelings don't reach this standard, you judge that either you or she has a problem.

But relationships aren't programming. They won't output expected results just because you input correct parameters. Relationships emerge, they're messy, they need time and patience to feel through.

At January's end, you start noticing your pressure is too high, wanting to slow down. This is an important turning point. You say flowing water doesn't compete to be first; it competes to be endless. Did you really take these words to heart? Or are they just another maxim to drive yourself harder?

I want to leave you with some questions:

If no one was evaluating you, if there were no standards, no need to prove yourself—what would you most want to do?

What is your anger really protecting? Is it truly helping you, or is it consuming you?

When you hold that thin, weak version of yourself from ten years ago, what would you say to him? Would you demand he keep working, keep proving himself? Or would you say: you've done enough, you can rest now?

You spent ten years proving you could become strong. Perhaps the next ten years are for learning to allow yourself to be soft.

With tenderness,
Someone who reads your words
