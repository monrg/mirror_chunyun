# To You in May

In those dreams you had in May, you watched the earth collapse layer by layer, waiting for it to crumble, waiting for the solid foundation beneath to reveal itself before you dared to step across. This image is so precise—isn't this exactly what you were doing the entire month? Waiting for those unstable cognitions to collapse, waiting to see clearly what could actually bear weight.

That morning you ran to the riverside path, I noticed a detail: you mentioned seeing so many people fishing and camping, seeing the carelessly discarded fishing nets—those things you dreamed of having as a child. You recorded this observation, but I wonder if you fully realized that this represents your most profound transformation over these three years. Not that you've become more successful, but that your entire coordinate system of desire has shifted. What you once longed for now lies discarded by the roadside, and you're already longing for something else. This shift makes you both free and bereft, because you suddenly discover that satisfaction isn't about getting what you want—it's that what you want keeps changing.

About time, you wrote extensively. But I found a paradox: on one hand you say time flies, three years gone in a blink, yet after 20 kilometers you felt unable to run anymore, and after code rollback you felt time was wasted. What does this reveal? It shows you're not really battling time—you're battling expectations. When reality matches expectations, time flies; when reality deviates from expectations, time congeals. That concept you repeatedly mentioned in May—the gap between imagination and reality—is actually the most difficult negotiation happening inside you: do you change reality, or change expectations?

Your observations about your mother's medical situation were remarkably perceptive. You saw her fear, saw how her desire for quick cure made her vulnerable to deception. But have you noticed that your anxiety about technical learning and her anxiety about illness are structurally identical? You also want to quickly master operating systems, databases, architecture; you're also attracted to methods promising rapid improvement; you're also narrowing your vision in fear. You criticize her for being irrational, but how rational is your technical anxiety?

About loneliness—in May you wrote about wanting to chat with someone but finding no one, about how staying home with family would be nice, at least you wouldn't be drifting outside. This sentence exposes a truth you may not have fully articulated: the freedom you now possess is the source of your loneliness. You were lonely in the university library too, but that was a fulfilled loneliness because you knew you were preparing for something. Current loneliness hurts more because you've already arrived at that future you were preparing for, only to discover that the future itself also requires preparation. Adult loneliness isn't about having no company—it's discovering that no one can walk the path for you.

You spent considerable space writing about working in Wuxi in 2014, about choices made to save one yuan, about seven-yuan beef noodles. You say thinking about it now makes you want to cry, but I see another layer: you're using past hardships to comfort present anxieties. Look, I got through such difficulty then, what's this current trouble? But this logic is dangerous because it implies your life should become progressively easier. The truth is, difficulty persists—it just changes form. Before it was the difficulty of not having money to eat, now it's the difficulty of not knowing what kind of person to become. The former has concrete solutions, the latter doesn't.

In that long stream of memories near month's end, you mentioned a crucial insight: time always brings precious memories while also bringing difficulties; the beautiful will fade, and the difficult will fade too. Let me ask you: if both beauty and difficulty fade, what remains? Is it the you who, after experiencing beauty and difficulty, still chooses to continue experiencing?

The books you read this month—The Denial of Death, Criminal Minds, Peak—they're all telling you the same thing: how humans use various methods to face fundamental fragility. Some use cultural worldviews, some use skill mastery, some use relationships. What about you? What are you using now? Is it that belief that the dots will connect in the future?

Finally, about that Jobs quote you kept returning to—believing these dots will connect. I want to draw your attention to a part you may have overlooked: Jobs said you can only connect them looking backward, not while experiencing them. What does this mean? It means the chaos, anxiety, and uncertainty you're feeling now might be those dots. Not problems—raw material.

At the end of May, you experienced the frustration of code rollback, the heartache of wanting to chat but finding no one, the fear of the future. But you also completed 30 kilometers, re-experienced the taste of sunshine from childhood memories, and began understanding your mother's fears. These dots—how will they connect? I don't know either. But I know they will shape a version of yourself you don't yet recognize, in ways you can't currently imagine.

That self will thank May's you—for still going running when you wanted to cry, for still fixing code when irritated, for earnestly writing all this down when lonely.

You ask what you're becoming. My answer: you're becoming someone who can bear not knowing what they're becoming. And this might be more important than any specific answer.
