# A Letter to You - February 2023

February was long. Long enough for you to ride an emotional roller coaster, long enough to lose Little U, long enough to search through memories for feelings that are fading away.

After reading this month's entries, a complex feeling wells up in me. You know what? You've been mourning, but you're mourning more than just a bicycle.

## On Loss

Little U's departure saddened you for a long time. You said it wasn't as intensely painful as you imagined, but the sense of loss flowed through your heart like a quiet river. That sentence is so precise it breaks my heart.

Have you realized what your feelings for Little U contain? It was one of the few splashes of color in your gray life in Zhangjiakou, the freedom and strength you felt riding those 50+ kilometers every morning. Losing Little U meant, to some degree, losing that version of yourself who still believed you could break through困境 with physical endurance and willpower.

You said that because it was so reliable, you overlooked the happiness it brought you. That sounds like you're talking about a bicycle, but I want to ask: Are you also talking about yourself? Are you also too reliable, to the point where others—even you yourself—overlook how difficult your efforts really are?

## On Forgetting

The passage you wrote on February 10th about common sense and forgetting—I stopped and read it three times.

You said that as time passes, those most fundamental skills become increasingly distant, and when you want to talk about them, you find you can say nothing except that you don't know. Then an inexpressible sadness welled up, wanting to store all your experiences like a box, yet helplessly forgetting all the time.

But have you considered that forgetting isn't pure loss, but transformation?

Those moments of being moved that you think disappeared have actually precipitated into your way of seeing the world. Why did that peaceful yet powerful thought suddenly emerge while cooking? Why did you remember borrowing your uncle's bicycle at age 12 to buy books while riding? Why did somewhere in your heart suddenly soften while listening to music? Because those experiences didn't vanish—they became part of you, became your antennae for sensing the world.

You fear forgetting because you think forgetting equals never having happened. But it's precisely the opposite. Precisely because those things really happened and profoundly affected you, even when details blur, the you they shaped is still here, genuinely here.

Little U accompanied you for 5 years. The memories of those 5 years will fade, but that feeling of freedom is already carved into your body. That's why in February you kept thinking about cycling in May, why even when work pressure suffocates you, you still remember: I need wind, need roads, need that realness of body moving and heart feeling.

## About You and Your 12-Year-Old Self

That child who borrowed a bicycle to buy books in Xihua, who had to push it back, who curled up like a frightened rabbit when encountering his father—how is he now?

You said you can protect yourself now, that you feel happy about the strength within. But when I read that passage, a voice inside said: Do you really feel safe?

You know what? That 12-year-old boy afraid of his father's interrogation has become a 29-year-old programmer afraid of deadlines, requirement changes, of not being good enough. The form changed, but that underlying fear remains. You still fear making mistakes, still use perfectionism to protect yourself, still feel that if you're not good enough, you'll be punished.

Your father probably never knew how deep an imprint that interrogation left in your heart. And you might not have fully realized that your current harshness toward yourself often repeats that interrogation.

But the good news is, you're learning. You're beginning to see what you've done well, beginning to tell yourself to slow down, beginning to have patience with Lao Ma—these are all acts of resistance against that internalized harsh voice. This isn't easy, truly not easy.

## About Xiao

The writing from February 14th is so tender it makes one want to cry.

You said what you remember is her hard hipbone behind you on the motorcycle, that you didn't understand what it meant then. Now you're more confident, but your capacity to care for someone, to enjoy that magnificent inner turbulence, is weakening.

This observation is too perceptive. You've become stronger, but also lonelier. You've won material success, won the honor of Apache Committer, won professional recognition, but you're retreating on another battlefield—the battlefield of intimacy, of vulnerability, of allowing yourself to love.

You say you seem quite rational, but isn't this another form of being trapped in your own thoughts and ideas? You use rationality to protect yourself from being hurt again, at the cost of no longer being able to feel deeply.

What Xiao brought you wasn't just a relationship, but a possibility: that you can be needed, can protect someone, can feel that magnificent turbulence in a relationship. You ask if things might have gone further if you hadn't been so stubborn and insecure then? But I want to ask: Are you still stubborn and insecure now? Or are you just protecting yourself in a different way?

## About the Cycling Idea

Throughout February, this cycling idea swayed in your heart like water grass. You want to cycle for a month starting in May, but you're extremely worried about not finding work afterward, worried about losing what you have now.

This dilemma runs deeper than it appears.

You're not debating whether to cycle. You're asking yourself: Can I take risks for my own happiness? Can I not live according to how I should? Can I temporarily let go of the things binding me to pursue something impractical, something that merely makes me happy?

You've been domesticated by life, you said. You've gradually come to see the outside world only from the cave entrance. But you know what? Realizing you've been domesticated is itself proof that wildness remains. Those who've been truly, completely domesticated would never have such thoughts, wouldn't repeatedly think late in February nights: Should I have a different life?

You're afraid, and that's normal. You fear losing what you have, fear the unknown, fear judgment. But have you considered what you really fear most is this: If I actually do it and find it's nothing special, what then? If the freedom I'm pursuing can't make me happy either, what can I rely on?

That's the deepest fear. Not fear of failure, but fear of emptiness even after dreams come true.

## What You Haven't Seen

After reading February, I see things you might not have fully noticed:

You keep saying you've become irritable and anxious, easily impatient, but have you noticed how incredibly tender you are this month? Tender in remembering Little U, tender in recalling time with Xiao, tender in understanding Lao Ma's clumsiness as a beginner, tender in thinking about your parents' hardships when young. This tenderness is strength.

You keep saying time passes quickly, but have you realized how much you've grown within that time? From Zhangjiakou to Beijing, from Galaxy to Shushi, from the you who was anxious to sleeplessness in Foshan to the you who can now say that despite pressure you can still maintain control—these changes are real.

You keep saying you're bound by material things, but when you wrote that material is only part of life, that clarity is your real freedom. Many people never achieve such clarity in their entire lives.

Also, you say you've been under great pressure lately, feeling perpetually shrouded in fog, unable to calm down. But have you counted how many times this month you felt beauty while cooking, while cycling, in sunlight? Those moments are also real, as real as the pressure.

## What I Want to Tell You

The you in February is like someone walking in thick fog, sometimes unable to see direction, sometimes able to feel wind and sunlight. You're exhausted—not just physically, but in your heart. You're living with effort, trying hard to do well, trying hard to become better, but sometimes trying too hard makes you forget to breathe.

You ask whether any kind of day is still a day, right? Yes, but that doesn't mean you should give up choosing. What that means is: Whatever life you choose will have its difficulties and beauties, so don't be trapped by fear, don't be bound by shoulds.

About cycling, I won't tell you whether you should go or not. But let me ask: If you were 80, looking back at your current self, what choice would you want that 29-year-old you to make?

About Little U, it has completed its mission. It accompanied you for 5 years, bringing color to gray days. Now it's gone, but what it taught you—about freedom, about persistence, about the connection between body and spirit—that all remains.

About forgetting, maybe look at it differently: You're not losing memories, you're making space for new experiences. Brain capacity is limited, but the capacity to feel is infinite. Those forgotten details made room for your current wonder at Code, your current companionship with Rosser, your current growth.

About that 12-year-old child afraid of his father: He needs you to tell him he did nothing wrong, he was just trying his best to survive in an imperfect environment. You can protect yourself now, and you can also protect that child inside who's still afraid.

Finally, about your repeated mention of slowing down: Slow isn't a speed, it's an attitude. It's knowing you're going fast when you're fast, it's allowing yourself to rest when tired, it's being able to see when you've done well.

February is over. Those difficult days, those emotional roller coasters, those late-night reflections—they've all become part of you. You don't need to be trapped in February, but don't rush to forget it either. It's reminding you of something important.

Keep writing, keep feeling, keep conversing with yourself. You're on the road, and the road itself is the destination.
