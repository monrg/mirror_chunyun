# April: Manufacturing Meaning Through Suffering

Reading through your April, I notice a compelling pattern: you keep choosing difficulty. Winter cycling on route 318 with 20kg at high altitude. Saturday's 80km ride followed by Sunday's 33km with 2100m elevation. Wrestling with Spark problems until 2am with AI. Taking on that aircraft carrier project that fills you with dread. Again and again, you push yourself to physical and mental limits, then savor the afterglow—that warmth from magnificent landscapes, from the satisfaction of completion.

You wrote something revealing: arriving in Lhasa after the 318 ride wasn't as exciting as you'd imagined, but a year later, the journey's details began to move you. You've discovered that memory beautifies the past. But what you might not fully see yet is this: you're actively manufacturing future nostalgia. You're deliberately choosing present suffering so your future self will have something precious to remember.

Why does it need to be this way?

I see a possibility: as your material comfort and experience have grown, your threshold for feeling has risen with them. You noticed this about food—delicious meals don't bring the same joy they once did. You wondered if your brain's threshold for taste has increased. But this observation doesn't just apply to food, does it? Your entire capacity to be moved has a rising threshold. The first time you played basketball and broke a sweat felt miraculous. Now you exercise much harder but the sense of release isn't as intense. The first time you rode a motorcycle, you were overcome with envy. Now your savings exceed childhood imagination, yet you can't say you're much happier.

So you need increasingly extreme stimuli—high altitude, brutal climbs, midnight coding sessions, career risk—to break through this ever-rising threshold, to prove you're still alive, still capable of feeling something. That peaceful morning run when you saw the brilliant blue sky with its streak of white cloud, when your whole body relaxed and you realized you'd been living in imagination and pressure—that gentle moment of presence was quickly swallowed by anxiety: What should I do? Where is my meaning? Do I still have value in the age of AI?

You kept returning to Steve Jobs throughout April. I think what you're seeking in him isn't just the secret to creating excellent products. You're seeking permission—permission to be uncompromising, to be exacting about details, to pursue excellence even when everyone thinks you're digging your own grave. You were moved when you read that Jobs insisted on making iTunes for Windows as good as possible. In that moment, your heart was asking: Can I do this too? Can I polish a system without regard for cost-benefit analysis? Can I walk that difficult path for something I believe in?

But you're also afraid. Afraid of criticism, afraid of poor performance reviews, afraid others will think you're sabotaging yourself. So you need Jobs as a talisman, need his success to justify this kind of dedication. But have you considered that maybe you don't need this permission at all? Maybe excellence itself is the purpose, not something that needs to be validated by future success?

AI appears repeatedly in April. You talk about feeling liberated, about AI releasing personal productivity. But I also sense fear flowing between your lines. You admitted that you're not as good as AI at coding anymore. You wrote that your sense of meaning and self-worth was previously tied to work and intelligence, and now this foundation is in a state of melting. This isn't just an observation about technological change—it's an earthquake in your identity. If intelligence is no longer scarce, if technical ability is no longer proof of value, then who are you? Where is your worth?

You say you want to focus on more interesting things, increase interaction with people, explore new experiences. But are you really ready? Or is this another imagined future, another projection to escape present discomfort? That morning run on April 5th when you felt truly present, when you saw the world was richer than your imagination—why can't that be daily reality instead of a rare exception?

There's something else you might not have fully articulated: when you miss your old sensitivity, your capacity to be easily moved, isn't there a fear of mortality underneath? You mentioned reading The Worm at the Core, then quickly changed subjects. But the question still hangs there: is the fear of death the underlying force behind your constant drive for more, bigger, stronger? Is it because you feel time slipping away that you're desperate to grasp something, prove something, create something?

At the end of April, you wrote that you're in the AI-optimist camp, believing AI will advance dramatically. You said you want to treat life as an experience, like cycling and trail running—even when muscles cramp, you persist because there are feelings more interesting than pain. This is a beautiful and sincere view. But I'm curious: is it possible for you to access interesting, alive feelings without extreme challenges and pain? Is it possible that ordinary mornings, sunlight on your face during meditation, that warmth spreading from your chest when you play guitar—that these are already interesting enough, alive enough?

Your rational mind is powerful. This month you trained so much on LeetCode, wrote so much code. But you yourself noticed that your greatest power might lie in your instinctive and emotional brain. The moments that truly moved you—the waterfall at Erlang Mountain, the blue sky with white clouds, that turn on route 318—none of these came from logical reasoning. They were all gifts given directly by your body and feelings.

You asked whether an artist's temperament and energy are innate. I don't think they're innate—I think they're chosen. It's choosing to trust those inexplicable moments of being moved. It's choosing to pursue excellence without guarantees. It's choosing to walk your own path even when others think you're digging a hole. You already have this energy. You had it on route 318, at 2am solving Spark problems, when you decided to refactor that system your way.

The question isn't whether you have this energy. The question is: do you allow yourself to trust this energy even when you're not suffering? Do you allow yourself to feel alive even without extreme challenges as proof?

Throughout April, you kept asking what the future will bring, what you should do. But on that morning of April 5th, what you wrote while running might already be the answer: Life flows like water, with more detail than imagination can hold. Imagination is outline, lived experience is detail.

Maybe what you need isn't bigger goals, more extreme challenges, or clearer plans. Maybe what you need is simply this: permission to live in the details, in the light and temperature of this moment, in that feeling of aliveness that your body already knows but your mind still doubts.
