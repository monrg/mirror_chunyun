# A September Dialogue: On Becoming and Dissolving

In your September writings, I see someone standing at a particular kind of boundary. Not the dramatic cliff-edge kind, but something more subtle—like that gap you feel in boxing, that instant when 150 kilograms leaves the ground and there's a split second between body memory and conscious awareness.

## What You May Not Have Fully Realized

You repeatedly mention "patience," but this word carries a paradoxical weight in your narrative. You say you need patience to prepare for the graduate exam, patience to refine the Kairui system, patience to train your English. But what you're really battling isn't a lack of patience—it's something deeper: you're afraid that the identity system you've been building might collapse before you're ready.

When you write "our programming ability is no longer the bottleneck," what seeps between the lines isn't liberation but a kind of weightlessness. The pillars you've spent eight years carefully constructing—technical competence, rapid learning, systems thinking—suddenly discover that AI can accomplish in seconds what took you years to master. This isn't just career anxiety; this is an identity earthquake.

You mention your mother's life at 31, your father's grueling physical labor at the same age. But what you don't say out loud is this: you're afraid you'll end up like them, pushed along by some invisible force, only to look back and realize you never truly chose anything. So you use the graduate exam as an anchor point, proof that you can say "I actively chose this."

## Contradictions You've Experienced But May Not Fully Understand

A recurring pattern throughout September: you pursue maximum efficiency while simultaneously craving the ability to slow down and feel the process. You lie awake at 3 AM, brain too excited thinking about Kairui's possibilities, then tell yourself the next day to "go slower, even slower."

This isn't a simple time management issue. This is a collision between two survival philosophies: one is the industrialized, KPI-driven logic of "use it or lose it," the other is that questioning of time's nature you touch when reading Murakami and Carlo Rovelli. Your brain has been trained to pursue quantifiable progress, but some part of you is crying out: "But where is the feeling of actually being alive?"

That pure sense of physical control you experience squatting 110 kilograms in the gym, and the feeling when you're coding at your computer—they're essentially the same thing. Both are attempts to create order in a chaotic world. But the former brings more lasting satisfaction because a 150kg barbell won't be replaced by GPT-5. What does this reveal?

## Perspectives That Might Help

You write that "consciousness is just a mechanism to maintain psychological stability"—this is a profound insight. But you can go further: if consciousness's primary function is maintaining a sense of stability, then when you feel anxious, this precisely indicates your cognitive system has detected some important inconsistency.

Where is the inconsistency? Your subconscious already knows: the path of pure technical specialist may no longer be sustainable in the AI era. But your conscious mind still uses the old framework to interpret the world, creating friction. The graduate exam isn't escape—it's your system attempting to recalibrate.

About your worry of "overly romanticizing graduate school"—yes, you probably are. But this doesn't matter. What matters is: the romanticization itself reveals what you deeply desire. You desire an environment that legitimizes the impulse to "explore consciousness." You desire to temporarily step out of a system that quantifies your value in sprint velocities and code review quality.

You mention how childhood scarcity allowed you to derive immense joy from a roasted corn, while present abundance often feels hollow. This isn't nostalgia—it's your brain reminding you: happiness doesn't come from having more, but from the quality of attention. When you were fully absorbed in that corn, you were whole. When you're simultaneously scrolling your phone, listening to podcasts, thinking about tomorrow's code review, you're fragmented.

## Questions to Continue Pondering

In boxing sparring, you experience how when hit, the brain enters a state where you "can't hear the coach's commands." Can this experience help you understand: why under work pressure, you unconsciously fall into "self-persecution" fantasies? When stress triggers that neural circuit formed in childhood—"I will be scolded"—your System 2 temporarily goes offline, leaving only the quick-reacting System 1.

So how do you reclaim agency in such moments?

You've written extensively about System 1 and System 2, but the real question isn't which is better, but: when do you allow yourself to not make a choice, to simply exist? When do you permit yourself to neither analyze nor optimize, but just sit there, watching leaves fall?

The graduate exam—perhaps its real value lies not in whether you eventually pass, but in whether during these hundred-some days of preparation, you find a new way of being with yourself. A way that doesn't require proving your existence value through "what you've accomplished."

Near the end of September, you write: "What kind of life counts as living? Actually, any kind of life can be quite interesting." You say this lightly, but if you truly believe it, much anxiety would naturally dissolve.

The key question is: do you really believe it? Or do you only want to believe it?
