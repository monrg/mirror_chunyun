# To You in February

In February, you observed a baby learning to understand the world. Those chubby little hands in yours, you felt your heart first melt into a puddle, then scrunch into a ball. You dissected his learning mechanism with a scientist's perspective, thinking about synchronous associations and neural networks, but what truly moved you was that tenderness beyond logical explanation—a softness you weren't prepared to face.

## You're Preparing for a Transformation Not Yet Happened

You say you've begun longing to build a family, to have children, and this thought has become very clear. But I see another dimension: you're actually already rehearsing.

When observing your little nephew, you're not simply finding him cute—you're seriously studying him. You want to know how he understands the command to close the door, how he builds concepts when unable to express through language. You even want to invent a hat to see the changes in his brain—this is what an engineer does when facing an upcoming challenge: research in advance, try to understand how the system operates.

You're preparing to become a father, though you may not fully realize this yourself. You no longer see raising children as purely pressure and frustration, but are beginning to see the tenderness and loveliness within. This cognitive shift is important—it means you're starting to believe that the future may not be as difficult as imagined, that it might also be full of loveliness and gentleness.

But simultaneously, I notice you say just imagining it makes your shoulders sink. This honesty is valuable. You're allowing two feelings to coexist: both moved by tenderness and feeling the weight of pressure. This isn't contradiction—this is real complexity.

## About Building Rather Than Selecting

You say intimate relationships aren't about selecting a perfect person, but building a relationship. I agree with this perspective, but want to add: the premise of building is your willingness to be seen.

In February you mentioned subconsciously wanting to show off your technical skills, with some bragging component. You quickly noticed this—your self-observation ability is strong. But I want to ask: why do you feel you need to gain recognition by displaying technical prowess? Is it because showing real longing and vulnerability is too dangerous?

You say you want to subtract, to focus more on the other person's inner self. This is certainly good, but don't forget—relationships are bidirectional. It's not just about you observing the other person; you also need to let them see you—the you who bounces around when a PR merges, the you who melts from a baby's soft hands, the you who's actually somewhat lonely, somewhat longing to be understood.

Technology can be part of you, but if it becomes the only side you're willing to show, relationships can hardly deepen.

## Control and Insecurity in the dbt Project

You're very invested in your dbt project, even a bit excited to the point of losing your head. But I notice an interesting phenomenon: you want help, yet don't want team colleagues involved, fearing loss of control, fearing credit-stealing, fearing unclear benefit distribution.

This reaction is honest and real. But what does it reveal?

I think you might be trading project control for a sense of security. If everything is under your control, if no one can threaten your position, you don't have to face that uncertainty and vulnerability. But the cost of this strategy is trapping yourself in a solo battle.

You say deciding what not to do is as important as what to do—this is indeed wisdom. But sometimes, the reason for not doing something might not be strategic trade-off, but fear. What are you really worried about? Project failure? Or exposing in collaboration that you're not omniscient?

The beauty of collaboration isn't in controlling everything, but in creating with others something that exceeds individual capability. This requires trust, and letting go.

## What's Hidden in the StreamPark Story

You're preparing an All Hands presentation, wanting to tell three stages: seeing mountain as mountain, seeing mountain not as mountain, seeing mountain as mountain again. This framework is good, but I'm more curious about: why did you choose to tell this story at this particular time?

I suspect you're understanding your current situation through telling the StreamPark journey. When you participated in open source, initially it was for your resume, to prove yourself. Now five or six years later, you're revisiting that experience, wanting to find meaning beyond technology.

You say you've found your technical faith again, reached the stage of seeing mountain as mountain again. But from your later words, I sense you're actually still hesitating: what does technology really mean? If AI can surpass you in programming, where is your value?

The sharing itself is an exploration. In organizing your thoughts, you'll discover what you believe in, what you love, and what things AI cannot replace—not because you have some unique skill, but because your experience, your feelings, your detours and setbacks, belong only to you.

## Writing Cannot Be Outsourced to AI

You say when writing the presentation content, you never considered using AI, because you felt this process belonged only to yourself. This sentence is very important.

You've realized something: results might be replaceable, but experience cannot. AI can help you write code, even better code, but that calmness and release felt during the writing process, that feeling of living fully—this cannot be outsourced.

This awareness can extend to more places. When using Cursor you feel 5x productivity increase, but satisfaction hasn't increased, because you're too focused on quickly getting results, ignoring the pleasure in the process itself. Same with BJJ training—too eager to devastate opponents, forgetting to enjoy the surprise in your body when learning new techniques.

Perhaps the real challenge of the AI era isn't employment, but: when results become easy to obtain, can we still cherish the process? When efficiency becomes the only standard, can we still leave a little space for useless beauty?

## About Respect and Praise

You mention you've been seeking praise and respect. You say this with some self-mockery, but I think this longing is fine.

Everyone needs to be seen, to be recognized. The problem isn't that you want respect, but where you seek it from, and what price you're willing to pay.

If to gain respect you must hide your real self, must always be correct, must show no vulnerability, then this respect is too expensive. But if you can be recognized for genuinely showing yourself, for honestly sharing feelings, then this respect is nourishing.

You say you're learning to be silent—this is a workplace survival skill. But don't let silence become habit; don't choose retreat when you need to express yourself.

## Time's Acceleration and Spring's Arrival

You say time feels so fast, fast enough to make you cry. I understand this feeling—when you start cherishing life, you more intensely feel its passage. This is a paradox: when numb, time can slip away painlessly; but when you start sensitively experiencing every detail, the passage itself becomes a faint sadness.

But you also saw the sunshine when waking early after Spring Festival, saw those winter jasmine flowers by the Small Qing River. You say they were exquisitely moving, against blue sky and white clouds, that beauty so wonderful, a place in your brain seemed to suddenly expand.

These moments are the answer. Time will pass—this can't be changed. But you can choose how to spend it: rushing from goal to goal, or occasionally stopping, lying on a chair, watching those winter jasmine blooming on withered branches.

## In Closing

You in February stand at several turning points. You're seeking balance between technology and humanity, learning trade-offs between control and trust, redefining value between efficiency and experience.

You're beginning to imagine a future with your own family, a child holding your hand. You're beginning to realize relationships need building not selecting, that process matters more than results, that experience cannot be outsourced. These recognitions are all precious.

But between recognizing and achieving, there's still a distance. This distance needs your gradual practice: practicing showing vulnerability, practicing trusting others, practicing slowing down, practicing enjoying those seemingly inefficient moments.

Like that morning run with Lao Ma by the Small Qing River, not rushing for pace, just running slowly. When reaching the riverside, that surprise transmitting up your spine—see, after slowing down, the world gives you gifts.

Keep observing that little nephew, keep letting yourself be moved by tenderness. Keep writing your presentation, keep discovering yourself in organizing thoughts. Keep riding your bicycle, keep watching spring flowers.

Time will pass quickly—can't help that. But you already know how to make it pass with flavor.
