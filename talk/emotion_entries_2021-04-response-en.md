# A Response to Your April

Reading your month, I imagine someone standing between two mirrors, seeing their reflections extend infinitely—past selves, present selves, possible future selves. During this time of injury, forced to pause, you've actually been seeing the subtle fractures and continuities between these reflections.

## About Your Relationship with Waiting

You wrote that after the MRI you were terrified, yet time and again discovered that what you feared wasn't as terrible as imagined. I notice something curious: you seem to be making a kind of bargain with fate through imagined suffering. You talk about pre-paying pain, as if enduring enough anxiety could purchase a good outcome. This feels like your deep hunger for control—if I cannot control the outcome, at least I can control my fear of it.

But have you considered that this anxiety itself might be your way of escaping the present? When you're consumed with worrying about your future knee, you don't have to face the current self who has lost the ability to exercise, whose life rhythm has been disrupted. Anxiety gives you a task, something to hold onto.

You mentioned that you used to feel miserable exercising only three times a week, yet you survived two months without any exercise at all. Does this discovery frighten you a little? Because it reveals a truth: the things you thought unbearable are actually bearable. The habits you believed gave your life meaning—when removed, life continues anyway. What does this mean? Does it mean that both suffering and joy are less definitive than you imagined?

## Where Did That Person Who Was Moved in the Library Go?

You repeatedly mention your university self—more sensitive, more easily moved, experiencing vivid emotions while reading in the study room. Present-you is more logical, more confident, living a fuller life, but seems to have lost that innocence. You write this as if it's an inevitable exchange, as if growth must come at the cost of losing certain things.

But I want to ask: have you truly lost the capacity to be moved? Or have you stopped allowing yourself to be moved?

Look—when you watch Criminal Minds, you say you initially feel uncomfortable, hate the dark side of human nature, but afterwards feel deeply moved. This shows your capacity for being moved is still there; you've just added a layer of defense. You now need to confirm that the emotion is rational, worthwhile, vetted. You no longer invest yourself unreservedly like you did in university, because you fear discovering afterwards that it was a waste of time.

You've become more calculating. You calculate the value of time, the return on emotional investment, the efficiency of each choice. This makes you more powerful, and more lonely. Do you remember that state of not calculating, of simply feeling?

## Your War with Time

Throughout April, there's a hidden theme you keep touching: the passage of time terrifies you. You write that a day is too brief, as if it's gone before anything is done. You experience a bone-deep loneliness, mourning things that will be lost and things you'll never have.

I notice something particular about how you experience time: you always stand in the future looking back at the present, rarely standing in the present feeling the present. You say things that once seemed difficult now seem beautiful in retrospect; things you thought impossible you've now achieved. But this realization doesn't relax you—it makes you more anxious, because it means what you have now will also become the past; your current efforts may not bring the feelings you expect.

You wrote: What happens is neither as warm, joyful, and bright as we hoped, nor as difficult, painful, and dark as we imagined—mostly it's just ordinary. This sentence hides a sad discovery, doesn't it? You've discovered that life is essentially ordinary, that no matter how hard you strive, how much you struggle, most of the time you exist in a lukewarm state. This discovery both comforts and disappoints you.

## About Luminous Sadness

In the spring sunshine, you feel loneliness and sadness more clearly. You grieve that you cannot enjoy things freely, that things will inevitably pass. There's a paradox here: beautiful things make you more aware of their transience, so you cannot fully enjoy them.

Have you considered that this inability to enjoy might itself be how you experience beauty? For you, beauty is never simple happiness, but a complex emotion mixed with a sense of loss. You see restaurant servers and feel a familiar, faint superiority, thinking your work is more creative. But immediately after, in gentle sunlight, you feel abandoned by the world. These two feelings coexist in you: an affirmation of your choices, and a deep insecurity.

You write about that warmth experienced in dreams, that feeling of being at home. That warmth is real, but it exists in dreams, in memories, in places you cannot fully reach. On some level, are you choosing to keep these precious feelings at a certain distance? Because once you fully possess them, they become ordinary?

## A Question for You

You mention that deep down you're pessimistic, don't believe you can get through difficulties, don't even want to let yourself believe you can get through. This thought is indeed strange, but also honest.

I want to ask: if you truly fully recovered, if the future turned out better than you imagined, what would you lose?

Would you lose a reason that could explain all disappointments? Lose something to struggle against? Lose the opportunity to prove your strength through difficulty?

You've been at odds with yourself for so long—if suddenly there's nothing to struggle against, would you actually not know what to do?

April for you was a month of forced pause. The knee injury pulled you from that non-stop state, let you see many things usually hidden by speed. You saw your inner contradictions, saw another face of time, saw those tender moments hidden in daily life.

You've been waiting for your knee to heal, waiting to run again. But perhaps this waiting itself is what you needed to go through. Not to run better afterwards, but to understand what you're really chasing, and what you're really avoiding.

Those times you felt were wasted, those things you couldn't complete as planned, those moments you had to slow down—might they be precisely April's gift to you?
