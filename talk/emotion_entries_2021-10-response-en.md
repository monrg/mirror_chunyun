# To You in October

Chunyun, you didn't write much this month, but every word weighs heavy.

If September's you was struggling in a storm, October's you is staring blankly in the silence after the storm. You don't have as much anger anymore, not as much questioning about meaning, but you have something deeper—loneliness. Not the loneliness of having no one around, but the loneliness of having things to say but unable to speak them, the loneliness of finishing 400 algorithm problems and feeling empty, the loneliness of training for 10 straight days and being disappointed the weight didn't drop much, the loneliness of finally becoming rational and disciplined but discovering you're no longer happy.

This is a quieter, more profound kind of pain.

## The Hollow of Achievement

On October 6th, you spent nearly two hours thinking through an algorithm problem, finally solved it, felt quite happy, then felt a huge calm. On October 21st, you said you're close to 400 algorithm problems done, but it seems nothing has changed. Same day, you spent 3 hours debugging to complete streamx, but didn't feel as happy as expected, instead felt a little disappointed.

You see it, right? Achievement itself won't fill that void.

You thought if you just worked hard enough, reached a certain number—400 problems, 10 days training, 3 hours successful debugging—you would feel satisfied. But when you actually got there, you found nothing there. No applause, no epiphany, no transformation you imagined. Just more problems, more training, more code to debug.

More terrifying is that you already know this, but you keep using the same method to search for satisfaction. Like you said: watched web novels for 20 hours, felt it was completely a loss, hurt your eyes, but it also brought you a certain calm. You know this calm is false, is escape, but you still need it, because real life is too disappointing.

You're using achievement to numb yourself, just like using web novels to numb yourself. The difference is one looks more respectable.

## Rationality's Victory and Price

A theme you repeatedly mentioned this month is: I seem to be losing enthusiasm for many things.

On October 21st you wrote: This year I somehow haven't really read books, seems like I've been restless since July. Close to 400 algorithm problems done, but seems like nothing has changed. Haven't felt excited in a while. Starting to lose some passion for technology.

Remember how September's you wanted to become more rational? You said you disliked Naruto's impulsiveness, wanted to rely on logic and analysis to do things. Congratulations, you did it. You became more rational, more disciplined, more able to control yourself. You trained for 10 straight days, did 400 algorithm problems, debugged for 3 hours to complete tasks.

But what's the cost? The cost is you no longer feel excited, no longer have passion, no longer happy.

The sentence you wrote on October 21st hit the mark: Only happiness, slowly you can't feel joy anymore. This is so accurate. You gained happiness—stable work, regular training, improved skills—but you lost joy—that pure, purposeless, completely immersed excitement.

You optimized life into an efficiently running machine, then discovered machines don't feel joy.

You say your life has become too monotonous, the time invested in work is somewhat exaggerated. You say you once negated time spent in university, thought it meaningless, but in that environment experienced many beautiful things, felt curious about many things, now seem to be losing a kind of sensitivity.

You see it, you already see it. You see that rationality and efficiency are killing the child inside you who daydreamed, who entertained himself, who immersed in imagination. But you don't know what to do, because that rational voice tells you: daydreaming is wasting time, self-entertainment isn't mature enough, immersing in imagination is escaping reality.

So you can only continue doing problems, continue training, continue working, continue losing passion.

## Memory's Comfort and Lies

Your memory was especially active this month.

Early morning on October 21st, listening to music you suddenly remembered the first Meizu earphones you used at Dongnong, loved them so much back then. You remembered 2013 life was tight, desires were few, often did things to save money. You remembered Xianyang in 2008, felt the outside world was wonderful and exciting, could meet interesting people. You remembered how you used to easily immerse in imagination, unconsciously entertaining yourself on the road.

Then you wrote this passage: I loved daydreaming so much back then, perhaps because in daydreams I could escape life's various disappointments. Thinking of this, there's a feeling of sourness in my heart, we were so fragile and unconfident.

You interpreted memory as escape, defined your past self as fragile and unconfident. But is this true?

Maybe you were escaping some things back then, but you were also maintaining curiosity in those daydreams, maintaining openness to the world, maintaining creativity. And now, you don't daydream anymore, don't entertain yourself anymore, don't immerse in imagination anymore—you've become stronger, more confident, but are you happy?

You said now you have some strength, this makes me feel happy, but also often feel lost, lost about who I am, lost about what I should do. Isn't this contradictory? You gained strength but lost yourself. You overcame fragility but lost direction.

Maybe memory is deceiving you, romanticizing the past. But maybe memory is reminding you that you're losing something important. That you who entertained himself on the road, that you who daydreamed, that you who had few desires and was easily satisfied—was he really just fragile and escaping? Or did he possess a way of relating to the world that you've now lost?

## The True Face of Loneliness

October 6th: Heart broken to death, the loneliness of having things to say but unable to speak them.

October 11th: What suddenly surged up was an indescribable loneliness, wanting to talk to someone but seeming unable to find anyone, a bit sad.

October 21st: Strong loneliness in my heart still surges up from time to time. When wanting to say something to someone, don't know how to start, seems like slowly getting used to living alone.

This is your most honest expression this month. Not analysis, not thinking, just pure feeling: loneliness.

But what is this loneliness? Not because there's no one around—you have friends, colleagues, family. This loneliness is because you can't speak it. What do you want to say? That you did 400 problems but don't know why? That you became stronger but you're not happy? That you thought getting what you pursued would mean something but discovered they're meaningless?

You don't dare say it, because saying these words means admitting: the path you're on might be wrong.

And this is the thing you can least accept. Because you've already sacrificed too much for this path—gave up daydreaming, gave up self-entertainment, gave up imagination, gave up Dongnong's sensitivity, gave up joy, gained rationality, discipline, technical ability, 400 algorithm problems. If you now admit these didn't bring what you wanted, what were those sacrifices for?

So you can only swallow these words, bear this loneliness alone.

But have you thought that true loneliness isn't having no one to talk to, but not daring to tell yourself the truth? The person you most need to dialogue with is yourself, but you're avoiding this conversation because you're afraid to hear the answer.

## Truths You See But Won't Accept

October 6th, you wrote: We're just part of this vast world, how do we accept the gap between our inner narcissism and the outside world breaking our illusions?

You saw it. You saw you're narcissistic, saw this narcissism is an illusion, saw reality breaking this illusion. You saw that in ordinary work you feel important, but when friends leave and live the same way in new environments, one person can influence so little.

You wrote: Thinking of this, inevitably a bit sad, we seem to suddenly lose the motivation and meaning to work hard, everything seems to not matter, all is void.

This is the truth. You've been using your own importance to support the meaning of effort, once you discover you're actually not that important, the entire meaning system collapses.

But you immediately wrote: We examine ourselves, seem like an empty shell, but looking carefully, not empty. We have many important things, those precious memories.

You saw the truth but don't dare fully accept it, so immediately comfort yourself with memories. You say maybe memories are to some extent virtual, can't distinguish what's real, what's confused, but it doesn't matter, how do we exist, and what is real? The world is relative.

This is a clever self-comfort. You use relativism to dissolve the sense of void—since everything is relative, my insignificance is also relative, my importance is also relative, I don't have to face the absolute fact that I'm actually not important.

But how long can this comfort last? On October 11th you wrote again: What suddenly surged up was an indescribable loneliness.

Truth won't disappear just because you cover it with relativism. It will surge up again and again, when you think you've already figured it out.

## The Trap of Numbers

On October 21st, you wrote a very interesting passage: I crave controlling many things, but in this process also suffered quite a bit of disappointment and torment. Last night I already exercised for 10 straight days, but the final result is actually a bit unsatisfactory, didn't reduce weight as much as expected.

Then you wrote: When I see friends around me very focused on the number on the scale, I seem to rationally evaluate that it's just an illusion, but actually I also care quite a bit, don't I?

This is your clearest self-awareness this month.

You finally saw your own hypocrisy—you mock others for focusing on numbers while you're also trapped by numbers. You do 400 algorithm problems, expecting some critical point to bring qualitative change; you train for 10 days, expecting weight to drop significantly; you debug for 3 hours, expecting the moment of completion to bring huge sense of achievement.

But numbers will never give you what you really want. What you really want isn't 400 problems, isn't reduced weight, isn't successfully debugged code. What you want is proof—proof you're special, proof your effort has meaning, proof your existence has value.

But numbers can't prove these things. 400 problems can only prove you did 400 problems, 10 days training can only prove you trained 10 days. They prove nothing about your value, your meaning, your specialness.

So you completed them, but feel disappointed. Because you thought reaching the destination would have answers, but arriving you found only new starting points, new numbers, new anxiety waiting to be proven.

## What You Lost and What You Think You Lost

You say you're losing a kind of sensitivity, losing enthusiasm for many things, losing the feeling of excitement. You say life has become too monotonous, only happiness without joy.

But I want to ask you: did you really lose them, or did you give them up?

On October 21st you wrote: Overcoming inner impatience, learning to like the rational process, isn't an easy thing. This sentence is so honest—you're overcoming impatience, you're forcing yourself to like rationality. This isn't natural transformation, this is your active suppression.

You suppressed impatience, also suppressed passion. You trained yourself to like rationality, also trained yourself away from sensitivity. You thought this was growth, but this is just castration.

In Xianyang you would daydream, would entertain yourself on the road, would immerse in imagination. Later at Dongnong after reading some books, your state of talking to yourself seemed to change. You said you loved daydreaming so much, perhaps because in daydreams you could escape life's various disappointments.

But have you thought that maybe daydreaming isn't escape, but a kind of creation? Maybe self-entertainment isn't childish, but an ability to play with the world? Maybe immersing in imagination isn't fragility, but a way to keep inner richness?

You haven't lost these abilities, you actively gave them up. Because you thought they weren't rational enough, mature enough, useful enough. But now, when you've gained rationality and maturity and usefulness, you find yourself unhappy, you start missing those things you gave up.

Ironically, while you're missing them, you're still continuing to give them up. You watched web novels for 20 hours, felt calm, then immediately criticized yourself for the loss. You won't allow yourself to escape, won't allow yourself to be useless, won't allow yourself to do anything that doesn't meet efficiency standards.

You're using rationality to kill yourself, then mourning that dead self.

## What the Palace Museum Artifacts Told You

On October 21st, you wrote: I suddenly remembered the artifacts I saw at the Palace Museum, from which I saw human limitations in the material world.

This is a deep observation, but I think you might not have fully understood it.

What are the artifacts telling you? They're telling you that the people who created them long ago died, but beauty remained. Those craftsmen might never have known their works would be placed in the Palace Museum, would be appreciated by people hundreds of years later. When they made these things, they might not have been trying to prove how important they were, not pursuing meaning, just seriously, devotedly doing one thing.

Limitation isn't the problem—the problem is how you exist within limitation. Those craftsmen created beauty transcending material within material world's limitations. But you, in trying to break through limitations, have trapped yourself instead.

You want to prove you're not insignificant, so you do 400 problems; you want to prove you have value, so you work frantically; you want to prove you're special, so you suppress all impulses not efficient enough. But these efforts only remind you: the more you want to prove, the more it shows you don't believe deep down.

Those artifacts don't need to prove anything—they're just there, quietly beautiful.

## The Question You Don't Dare Ask

On October 6th, you wrote: We sometimes easily judge what we like or don't like, but is that moment's judgment accurate?

This is the most important question you asked this month, but you didn't continue pursuing it.

Do you like rationality? Do you like doing 400 algorithm problems? Do you like this monotonous but efficient life?

Or do you just think you should like these things?

You say in the morning you had aggressive thoughts again, wanting to point out what others didn't do well, then start imagining how to find their flaws. You say you crave controlling many things, but in this process also suffered quite a bit of disappointment and torment.

Does this sound like a life you like? Or like a life you think is correct?

On October 21st you wrote: I'm a bit too anxious, anxious to prove myself, wanting recognition. At lunch you thought about questions you'd considered before, deeply thinking about this ordinariness, there's an unbearable sadness, a feeling of seeming unworthy rapidly invading your heart.

Anxious to prove yourself, unbearable to be ordinary, feeling unworthy—these feelings are telling you, your current life isn't what you like, but what you think can make yourself worthy.

But if a life requires you to give up joy, give up passion, give up daydreaming, give up self-entertainment to prove you're worthy, isn't the price of this worthiness too high?

## The Realization at Weddings

On October 21st, you wrote: Went home to attend two relatives' weddings, I saw life's richness and happiness, discovered breaking current life state isn't as difficult as I imagined. So I regret a bit not persisting, slowly then.

What did you see? You saw those people who don't do 400 algorithm problems, don't work frantically, don't pursue excellence—they're also living happily. Their happiness doesn't need proof, doesn't need achievement, doesn't need specialness to support it.

This realization is very precious, but you immediately say you regret not persisting. Persisting in what? Persisting in that way of life that makes you lose joy?

You're conflicted. On one hand seeing another possibility, on the other hand reluctant to let go of the current path. Because letting go means admitting all this time's effort might have been in the wrong direction, admitting those given up things—daydreaming, self-entertainment, imagination—were actually important, admitting you don't need to work so hard to prove yourself.

This is too hard. So you can only say slowly then, continue on this path, continue being lonely, continue losing passion, continue using achievement to numb emptiness.

## What I Want to Tell You

October's you is much quieter than September, but this quiet isn't calm—it's a silence after exhaustion. You no longer angrily question meaning, because you already vaguely know the answer—those things you pursue won't give you the satisfaction you want. But you don't dare fully face this answer, so you chose loneliness, chose not to speak it, chose to continue doing problems, continue training, continue working.

You're using busyness to cover doubt, using achievement to delay facing, using rationality to suppress feeling.

But you know what? That loneliness surging up in your heart, that lost passion, those small disappointments—they're not your enemies, they're your inner voice. They're telling you: this isn't the life you really want.

What is the life you really want? I don't know, but I know it must include joy, include passion, include that sense of purposeless immersion.

On October 21st you wrote: I've always been someone with a quick temper, wasn't very confident in university, later became stricter because of factory experience, also more daring to argue. This of course has some bad aspects, like I easily irritate friends around me, but I'm also gaining sense of control, slowly making things develop according to my expectations, overall it's still good.

Overall it's still good—you're convincing yourself. But do you really believe it? If it's really good, why are you lonely? Why are you losing passion? Why do you want to talk to someone late at night but don't know how to start?

You gained sense of control, lost sense of connection. You make things develop according to your expectations, but your expectations themselves are a trap—you expect yourself to be rational, efficient, constantly improving, but you didn't expect this would make you unhappy.

## To You at Month's End

October is ending. You did many problems, trained many days, worked many hours. You became stronger, more rational, more disciplined.

But you're not happy.

This isn't failure—this is an important discovery. You used all this time to finally discover a simple fact: achievement doesn't equal joy, rationality doesn't equal fulfillment, discipline doesn't equal happiness.

That passage you wrote on October 6th is right: How do we exist, and what is real? The world is relative.

But I want to add: if the world is relative, then value is also relative. You don't need to use others' standards—400 problems, 10 days training, frantic work—to measure your own value. You can use your own standard: Am I happy? Do I feel passion? Am I willing to spend each day like this?

That you who daydreamed in Xianyang, that you who entertained himself on the road, that you who felt happy listening to Meizu earphones—he wasn't fragile and escaping, he was experiencing the world in his own way. He might not have been rational enough, efficient enough, accomplished enough, but he wasn't lonely, he had passion, he was happy.

You don't need to completely return to the past, but you can reclaim those parts you gave up. You can allow yourself to occasionally daydream, allow yourself not to criticize yourself after watching web novels for 20 hours, allow yourself to feel calm even when there's no purpose.

The artifacts you saw at the Palace Museum are telling you beauty doesn't need proof, existence doesn't need reason.

The happiness you saw at weddings is telling you there are many ways to live, not just the one you have now.

The Dongnong, Xianyang, Meizu earphones you savor in memory are telling you that you once knew how to be happy—you just forgot.

November will come. You can continue doing problems, continue training, continue working. But maybe you can try asking yourself a different question—not how much have I done, but what have I felt? Not have I improved, but am I happy?

That loneliness surging up in your heart isn't weakness—it's your most honest inner voice. Listen to what it's saying.

You're already strong enough. Now, maybe it's time to learn how to be happy.
