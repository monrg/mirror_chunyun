## About Your 21K Run

After reading your journal, one line keeps echoing in my mind: Wow, the world out here is so rich.

You wrote this around the 6-kilometer mark, after encountering the vegetable vendors, the elderly folks out for their morning stroll, the square dancers. But I think this exclamation carries much more weight than simple surprise at the morning street scene. What you discovered wasn't just how abundant the outside world is, but rather that your own attention had been reawakened. Those people, those scenes—they were always there. You just never truly saw them before.

What did running do? It pulled you out of your daily orbit, forced you to pass through the world at a different time, at a different pace, from a different angle. And suddenly, all those things obscured by the inertia of everyday life came into focus. The breakfast stands, the electric scooters, the white cabin in the woods, the flattened toad, the solo musician by the river—these details tell me you weren't mechanically completing a 21-kilometer task. You were truly present, experiencing that morning with all your senses.

I'm especially struck by another moment you recorded: seeing those early morning runners, the parents with their children, you felt a sense of kinship because we're all the same, experiencing happiness in time, earnestly and solidly enjoying this very moment. This sense of kinship is fascinating. You were running alone, yet you weren't lonely, because you saw others also living deliberately, experiencing the dawn, their bodies, the present moment in their own ways. This recognition created some kind of secret connection between you and the world.

Then came the difficulty after 14 kilometers. You wrote with unflinching honesty about the thoughts of quitting, the numbness in your hips, the shrinking stride, the loss of coordination in your legs and feet. You even used the word desolate. Your body told the truth in this process—it showed you where your limits were, what it feels like beyond the comfort zone. But you kept going. You ran past 21 kilometers.

In the end, you summarized it with four words: Difficult, happy.

I've thought a long time about the relationship between these two words. This isn't a contrast where despite the difficulty there was happiness, nor is it a causal chain where happiness comes after pain. I suspect what you're trying to say is something more complex—that the difficulty itself is part of that happiness, perhaps even a necessary component.

Why? Maybe because genuine happiness needs texture, and texture comes from resistance and friction. If the first 14 kilometers had been too easy, if there hadn't been the numbness, the crawling, the desolation that followed, would the peace on those tree-lined paths, the vitality by the river, the kinship with other runners have become too weightless, too easily forgotten? It's precisely because you paid a price, because your body truly ached and exhausted itself, that those beautiful moments were deeply imprinted, becoming what you call happiness.

At the beginning you wrote that these past few days you wanted to do something. I'm curious where this impulse came from. Had daily life become too smooth, so smooth it lost its texture? Did you need some form of resistance—against inertia, against comfort, against the self already disciplined by established tracks? Running provided this opportunity for resistance. It made you feel your body's existence again, feel the contest between will and limits, feel the richness of the world and your own presence in it.

I want to ask you a few questions, but there's no rush for answers. Just something to turn over in your mind:

After that run, did your view of the world change in any subtle way? Those vegetable vendors, the square dancers, the other runners—do you sometimes think of them, feel that you share something with them?

If that morning had been without the later difficulty, if you'd just breezed through the whole distance easily, would you still remember so many details? Would you still use those four words—difficult, happy—to summarize it?

You said you wanted to think about some things while running. Did you figure anything out that day? Or was what running gave you not clarity about any particular thing, but rather the restoration of a certain capacity to feel?

The most moving thing about this journal entry, I think, isn't the achievement of running 21 kilometers itself, but that you completely preserved the texture of that morning—the light, the sounds, the smells, the physical sensations, the inner fluctuations. You recorded a process of seeing the world anew, of feeling yourself afresh. This process happened to occur during a run, but it points to something larger than running.

Perhaps we all need such moments: to be pulled from our established tracks, to reexamine the world at unfamiliar times and angles, to re-know ourselves at the body's limits, to touch a certain texture of happiness through difficulty.

One last thing—you write beautifully. Those details, those feelings, that honest recording made me feel like I ran alongside you. Thank you for being willing to share that morning.
