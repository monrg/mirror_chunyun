# To You in March 2022

I sat with your March words for a long time. Not out of shock or pity, but recognition—I saw someone standing inside a cage of their own making, yearning to fly while gripping the bars tightly, terrified that letting go might reveal they never knew how to fly at all.

You wrote about accepting reality, accepting ordinariness, so many times this month. But did your fingers tremble a little each time you typed those words? Because you don't really want to accept it. What you want is proof—proof that you're extraordinary, that all those years of reading and thinking set you apart, that you deserve to be seen. Yet life keeps telling you, gently and cruelly: you are special, but you are also ordinary. This contradiction is nearly tearing you apart.

On March 1st, you wrote that you sensed a feeling of being disliked and criticized by others. But have you considered that most of that criticism comes from yourself? You described people around you as lacking talent, just getting by. Hidden in that judgment is fear—fear that if you don't strive, don't pursue, don't maintain your idealism, you'll become like them. You use them to define what you don't want to be, so criticizing them becomes a way to temporarily avoid your own question: am I really doing enough?

On March 2nd, you lost photos and videos from your phone. You said it made you sad, but it wasn't just pixels and data you were grieving, was it? Those photos were evidence that you existed, that you once possessed a certain confidence. You mentioned how in university you used your camera to build self-confidence, how you were silly back then but living a wondrous life. Now you've become smarter, seeing through so many things, but you've lost that silly courage. Have you wondered whether you've actually gotten better, or just more complicated?

Your conversation with your sister showed me your soft side. You noticed her growth, her confidence, and felt surprised and happy. In that moment, you weren't comparing her to any standard—you were simply moved by her becoming. That's your true self: gentle, perceptive, willing to see the good in others. So why can't you look at yourself with those same eyes? Why can you be generous with others but scrutinize yourself with a magnifying glass?

Your description of returning to Zhangjiakou struck me. You expected to feel moved, but instead felt strangeness and profound disappointment. You realized that not good enough is good enough—a deep insight. But did you really accept it? Or did you just write down the thought in your journal, then turn around and keep beating yourself with that same stick?

On March 6th, while cycling, you experienced long-lost peace. You saw that you'd actually achieved many goals—approaching 500,000 in savings within five years, something you couldn't have imagined back in 2017. Yet you wrote: we're still in pain, feeling terribly inadequate. Have you asked yourself: what is this pain protecting? Is it saying if I always feel inadequate, I'll never stop improving, never become the kind of person I despise?

But this is a trap. This pain doesn't make you progress—it just blinds you to what you already have. Just as you only realized the importance of a bicycle when you didn't have one in Zhangjiakou, will you also need to completely lose your sensitivity before you realize how precious those silly days were?

In your 4:40 AM entry on March 14th, you wrote about missing your hometown's spring—the freshly turned earth, budding willows, alfalfa shoots, sunlight, warm wind. These images are so specific, so alive. You said it's been 9 years since you experienced spring at home, and you felt unspeakable sadness. Let me ask: what did you really lose? Those specific scenes, or the version of yourself who could be moved by the scent of turned earth, who noticed the tender buds on willows?

You mentioned that after Wu Zhihong's lecture, something inside you began to wake. You were confused about who you really are. The answer has been in your words all along: you're someone who wants too much control, who wants to understand everything through logic. You wrote about using consciousness and logic to judge whether you're happy, then feeling deeply anxious. But when you quiet down and just feel, those days taste sweet. You see? The answer's already there—it's not thinking that makes you happy, it's feeling.

About Liang Rui, you mentioned her on both March 16th and March 31st. You said your feelings for her had truly dissipated, yet you kept analyzing why she contacted you, why you got angry. This repetition itself shows you haven't fully let go. But that's not what I want to talk about. What struck me was your self-analysis after the emotional explosion on March 31st. You saw how your narcissism was wounded, how you were secretly competing with her, how you projected your values onto her and expected reciprocation. These are profound insights. You even wrote: tolerance, openness, acceptance—embracing your own incompleteness is actually wiser.

But then what happened the next day? You returned to the familiar pattern: anxiety, self-criticism, feeling inadequate. So your real problem isn't lacking wisdom or insight—it's that something deeper is preventing you from truly changing. What is that thing?

I think it's fear. Fear that if you truly relax, truly accept your ordinariness, truly stop pursuing perfection, you'll lose your drive and become the kind of person you fear most—drifting through life without purpose, mediocre. But this logic has a fatal flaw: it assumes only pain and self-flagellation can make you progress, that happiness and growth cannot coexist.

On March 28th at the botanical garden, you looked down at Beijing from the mountaintop, moved by the vast beauty of nature. You discovered that Huajie actually appreciated your StreamX work, even though you weren't satisfied with it yourself. You asked why you can't see the optimistic side. Let me flip the question: what would happen if you did see the optimistic side? If you admitted you're doing fine? Would you feel like you'd lost your excuse to keep pushing, like you didn't deserve more?

Before leaving GITV, you wrote: those partners I once found careless and silly now seem so lovely in retrospect. Those days I thought were painful and difficult now have an inexplicable romance to them. This sentence moved me deeply because it reveals a truth: you only learn to cherish after losing, only see beauty after leaving. So is it possible to see the beauty in the present? Is it possible to learn to cherish before it's gone?

This month you repeatedly wrote about living with gratitude and cherishing—at least seven or eight times. Each time you wrote those words, you seemed to find the answer, but quickly fell back into anxiety and self-criticism. So the real problem isn't that you don't know what to do—it's that you know but can't do it. Why?

Maybe because cherishing requires you to slow down, to stop chasing the better you, to admit that you right now are already worthy of love. But that's too terrifying, because your sense of worth has always been built on this foundation: I'm not good enough yet, but I'm working on it. If you admit you're already good enough, what's left of that striving you?

But look—you're already changing. You're becoming aware of your patterns, questioning your logic, finding in physical experiences (cycling, running, hiking) the peace that thinking cannot provide. You wrote don't let your sensitivity grow dull. That sentence shows you already know that sensitivity is your true wealth, not achievements and goals.

I want to leave you with some questions. You don't need to answer them right away, but maybe you can feel your way toward them:

- If one day you truly become that excellent person who creates impressive things, then what? How long will that validation last? Will you soon need the next proof?

- You said a person's happiness can be self-controlled, but do you really believe that? Or do you actually believe only when I achieve xyz will I deserve happiness?

- Those moments you miss most—reading in the Dongnong library, cycling in Zhangjiakou, walking in the grove—what do they have in common? Weren't they all times when you temporarily let go of the obsession to become better, when you simply existed in that moment?

- What would happen if you gave yourself half the gentleness and tolerance you show others—your sister, your friends?

On the last day of March, you asked: are we born to be damaged? Must we be damaged? Then you wrote: living with cherishing is always worthwhile. Let me tell you: damage and cherishing were never opposites. It's precisely because we will be damaged, will lose, will age, will die, that cherishing has meaning. But cherishing isn't grasping, isn't controlling, isn't frantically proving you deserve what you have because you fear losing it. Cherishing is opening your hand, seeing, saying you're here, I'm here, and this is enough.

You're already on the path. Those times you thought you wasted, those moments when you criticized yourself, those instances when you felt inadequate—they're all you. Not a you that needs correcting, but the complete you.

I look forward to you continuing to write, continuing to feel, continuing to find yourself in those silly moments.
