# To You in December

Chunyun, this month you're standing in a very special position. You're looking back at year's end, summarizing, wrestling with your own expectations, and in that wrestling slowly seeing some things clearly.

I want to talk with you about things you may not have fully understood yet.

## The Gap That Pains You Is Where Creation Happens

On December 7th you wrote: I desperately want to accomplish some things, but gradually feel that no matter what, I can't achieve what I imagine, the sense of loss is too strong.

You said you wanted to submit another PR to prove your technical ability, but these past days you haven't seen any features you can develop, your heart is very anxious. You can understand the code, can grasp the author's logic, but just can't quickly complete features you consider impressive.

Chunyun, have you thought that this gap - the gap between imagination and reality - isn't your failure, but creation itself?

In your imagination you can produce works that amaze people, but in reality you're making ordinary, even flawed works. This gap frustrates you. But think about it - before Murakami wrote Kafka on the Shore, were the images in his mind the same as his actual first draft? He also had to revise again and again, overthrow and restart, slowly approaching that wonderful thing through countless moments of dissatisfaction.

Creation never leaps directly from imagination to perfect work. Creation is in that chaotic, uncertain, frustrating gap, slowly groping, slowly trial-and-error, slowly approaching. You're standing in precisely this gap right now.

When writing code you felt what you did was meaningless, but later you discovered the script you developed could be reused, saving a lot of time, and you felt happy. You see, what you thought was meaningless - time will tell you its meaning.

You long to leave praised works like excellent people do, but feel frustrated when facing ordinary, flawed works. I understand this feeling, but have you thought that those excellent works were also polished bit by bit from ordinary, flawed versions?

You're already doing it. You're developing DMP, learning frontend, submitting code to StreamX. In this process you feel progress isn't smooth, feel what you're doing is meaningless. But this is creation's true face - most of the time it feels this way, only occasionally are there surprises.

Don't rush to escape from this gap. Stay in it, keep doing in it, time will transform it into what you want.

## Your Body Is Teaching You About Creation

This month you wrote a lot about running and exercise. On December 13th you spent 6 hours preparing one social media post - cycling and running for 3 hours, back training for 1 hour, writing copy for 2 hours. You said this process's difficulty and irritation far exceeded your expectations.

On December 21st you wrote about that run - muscles unaccustomed, steps uncoordinated, fatigue appearing at 2 kilometers. You said fatigue that used to appear at least at 8 kilometers now appeared at 2 kilometers, suddenly no confidence you could finish 10 kilometers.

But have you noticed your patience with physical training is completely different from your attitude toward creation?

When running, you accepted this fact: stopped for a year, condition definitely declined. You breathed deeply to recover energy, accepted when pace dropped, and although you didn't finish 10 kilometers in the end, you didn't reproach yourself, instead saying: enjoying running is enough, distance is just a number.

When writing code, you give yourself none of this patience. You hope to immediately make impressive features, feel anxious when not seeing progress, feel it's meaningless when what you make isn't perfect enough. You tell your body: it's okay, slowly recover. You tell your mind: no, you must be excellent immediately.

Why?

In that passage you wrote on December 13th, you actually already gave the answer: you could say 70% of running is painful, but we still do it. What we need more is persistence, slowly enduring them, experiencing them.

You can endure running's pain because you know it's part of training, after pain is growth. But you can't endure creation's pain because you treat pain as evidence of failure, not as part of growth.

Your body is telling you: growth is like this - most of the time is painful, tedious, can't see progress, but in this process you accumulate bit by bit. Your knee refused to heal according to your timeline for four months, but it's slowly improving. Your creative ability is the same - it has its own rhythm, you can't rush it.

At the end of December 21st you wrote: running also cares too much about distance, whether running fast or slow, just enjoy running, the numbers recorded on the running app aren't everything.

Give this sentence to yourself writing code. Whether code is written fast or slow, whether features are simple or complex, just enjoy writing code, the numbers on GitHub aren't everything.

## About Pursuing Guo Xu, What You Misunderstood

Between December 7th and December 31st, you repeatedly recorded feelings about being with Guo Xu, finally deciding on December 9th to just be friends. You said the main reason for this decision was: love slowly emerges from the heart, or is accumulated bit by bit through many small things; without these small things, the seedling can't grow.

This decision is very mature, but I want to tell you: in this entire process, you didn't fail, you're growing.

When analyzing your state on December 7th, you wrote so many points: the discomfort of damaged self-esteem, the loss from the other's negative attitude, worry about your own lack of confidence, emotional fluctuations caused by too-high expectations. You see, you're observing your inner self very carefully, learning your emotional patterns.

You said you're learning how to understand others, how to get along with others, how to share topics, how to bring up topics, how to overcome inner shyness to do things you want to do. Aren't these your gains?

More importantly, in this process you saw clearly some of your patterns:

Your expectations are too high, thinking love would be as romantic as Zhao Min in The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber, but reality is ordinary. Your emotions fluctuate greatly, feeling strong loss when not getting corresponding feedback. Your lack of confidence appears, worried that others don't like what you say, worried you're not interesting enough.

Seeing these patterns clearly is itself huge progress. Many people live in these patterns their whole lives without knowing it; you saw them clearly in just one month and even summarized them.

And in your December 31st analysis, your advice to yourself is particularly good: lower expectations, love isn't as romantic as imagined but is worthwhile, needs patience and a peaceful state. Increase confidence, might as well do what you want to do, if she doesn't reply it's okay, you can enjoy that process's emotion and anxiety, but we need to know what reality is. Do some things sincerely, achieve what you can achieve.

You see, you're not only learning, you're also prescribing for yourself.

You said this process let you experience Xiao's feelings back then. You said: Xiao was actually a very enthusiastic girl, she waited for our response, now we've experienced her feelings at that time, tormenting in loss and struggle is quite uncomfortable.

The emergence of this empathy is such a precious thing. When experiencing your own loss, you understood others' past loss. When pursuing others, you understood those who once pursued you. This understanding will change how you view the past and how you interact with people in the future.

So about pursuing Guo Xu, the important thing was never the result, but your understanding of yourself in this process. You said: the main subject is not about her, but we want to try a new behavior, want to try to establish connection with others, want to feel some different feelings.

You already did it. You tried, felt, learned. That's enough.

## Time Isn't Deceiving You

On December 7th you said: our minds floated to when we returned home on May 1st walking on the field ridge, enjoying sunshine, enjoying nature, that feeling. We seemed to really truly experience that feeling or something.

Then you said: now we can experience many subtle emotions in our hearts, emotion and excitement are one kind, anxiety and worry are another kind, in that moment those feelings seemed so vivid, letting us experience a vitality, but in memory only a trace of aftertaste remains, we unconsciously doubt whether they really existed.

You're doubting memory's authenticity, doubting whether time diluted everything.

But Chunyun, that memory leaves aftertaste doesn't mean feelings at the time weren't real. Aftertaste is also a form of existence, even a more refined existence. Like tea brewing - the first steep is intense, but those who truly understand tea say the aftertaste of the third, fourth steep is tea's essence.

You experienced 100% concentration at the time, experience 10% aftertaste in memory - both experiences are real, and they don't conflict. You can fully feel in the moment, also savor the lingering flavor in memory - these are time's double gift to you.

You said: we didn't know that freely wandering in familiar environments was a wonderful thing, only after our knee was injured did we realize that exhilarating exercise was happiness, we just didn't know what meaning that had in that moment.

This isn't time's deception, this is time's education. Time is teaching you to cherish. You only understand cherishing after losing - this is human limitation, but also humanity's way of growing. Now you know exhilarating exercise is happiness, you'll cherish present days when you can run more. This awareness itself is time's gift.

On December 7th you wrote: from past experience, time's power is very strong, what we need is patience and absolute patience.

Yes. You're beginning to understand time.

In exercise you experienced nearly 10 years of training to have muscle strength where walking a big circle doesn't feel tiring. Same with programming - from 2013 to now, 8 years, you went from taking a long time to understand loops to now being able to complete complex code.

Time's power isn't immediate, it's silent nourishment. You plant a seed, water it daily, look at it daily, daily feel it hasn't changed much. But one day when you look again, it's already grown into a tree.

## About Learning Frontend

On December 16th you wrote: I originally particularly resisted frontend technology, but this time patiently deeply understanding it, the feeling is quite comfortable, also recognized that frontend is quite an important link.

You said you hesitated inside, afraid of spending time but unable to master it. But you also said: what is mastery? This depends on our positioning.

This self-dialogue is great. You're learning to let go of obsession with mastery, learning to accept that you can imperfectly learn some things.

You said: we're destined to be ordinary people, just enjoy the present, enjoy the feeling of doing things. I experienced a sense of fulfillment, the learning process itself isn't smooth sailing, slowly accumulate, like on the road of progress, when tired from walking rest a while, can also feel happiness.

You see, this month you're slowly relaxing your requirements for yourself. Not giving up requirements, but relaxing - from must be perfect to can be imperfect; from must master to can slowly learn; from must immediately see results to can enjoy the process.

This transformation is so important.

The real meaning of learning frontend isn't what level you ultimately master, but in this process you learned: can spend more time taking some detours, can not limit your own ideas, can let your whole state become different when encountering complex new things.

## Year-End Summary

The year-end summary you wrote on December 23rd is the clearest part of the entire December.

You said: I sometimes don't believe in time, feel time passed, nothing left behind. But you also said: patience is very important, must firmly believe, while also being prepared to endure tedium, loss and depression, this is worthwhile and important.

You see, in the same summary, you both expressed doubt about time and belief in time. You heard both voices, and you chose to believe.

You said: only after injury did I understand how precious and important the wealth I usually possess is. Sometimes we focus too much on material things, on things that can be simply judged by money. Life needs simplification, cherish those important and precious things.

This is deep understanding. In this year, through knee injury, through pursuing a girl, through submitting PRs, through learning frontend, you slowly understood what truly important things are.

You said completing a goal is a wonderful thing, but at the same time will fall into loss for one's own smallness, many things have two sides. From a long-term perspective, effort is important, must follow the inner voice, do 100% effort.

You accepted two-sidedness. This is a mark of maturity. You no longer expect pure happiness, you accept that happiness is mixed with loss, accept that achievement is mixed with a sense of smallness, accept this is life's true face.

Then you said: choose difficult but worthwhile things, enjoy creativity, believe in yourself.

This is your message to yourself for 2022, also the most important thing you learned in 2021.

## About December 31st's Void

On the last day, you wrote: I feel a slow but powerfully strong boredom, after waking can't muster even a bit of desire to do anything. The feeling that everything around has lost meaning is too uncomfortable.

You said: this feeling is like life is an illusion, all things are unreal.

Chunyun, this sense of void isn't a bad thing, it's a signal.

In this year, you worked hard to construct meaning: worked hard, studied technology, submitted PRs, learned frontend, pursued a girl, exercised. You sought meaning in action, proved yourself in achievement. These are all good, they made you grow.

But at year's end, these meaning structures suddenly shook. You found that after doing so much, there are still so many moments when everything feels meaningless. Those meanings you constructed seem not solid enough, not real enough.

In this moment, you're standing in a very special position: old meaning structures aren't enough anymore, but new meaning structures haven't been established yet. You're in an in-between zone, a vacuum zone, a void zone.

Many people never come to this zone in their lifetime because they always live in meanings given by others: make money, get promoted, marry, buy a house. These meanings are enough to support them, they don't need to question.

But you questioned. You asked: what meaning do these have? Why should I do these? Who am I?

These questions will push you into void, but will also let you find answers that truly belong to yourself.

When analyzing Naruto on December 31st you said: pursuing dreams doesn't mean becoming an ascetic, what we need is to enjoy this process. There may be no result, or the result may just be a summary of a process. When unable to endure reality's ordinariness and tedium, we unconsciously want to comfort ourselves through lofty results. Having goals is a beautiful thing, they make us focused, but the process is quite important.

You see, you're already giving yourself answers: don't use results to fight void, use process to fight void.

When analyzing pursuing Guo Xu you said: what kind of result I expect I actually don't know, maybe more that I'm learning, trying another kind of brain thinking and feeling I haven't experienced. Only by doing this can I know whether that choice is what I like, know what another world is like. This is quite an important thing.

You see, you no longer take results as the only evaluation standard, you're beginning to value the experience and learning that doing this thing itself brings.

When analyzing participating in open source you said: I achieved a goal this year, which is participating in open source projects. In these 5 days I experienced various feelings. A very important thing is I took the first step, the first step is indeed quite difficult.

You're beginning to see that taking the first step itself is meaning, no need to wait until achieving great results to count as meaningful.

These are all answers you groped for in the void. Void isn't the endpoint, void is a transfer station. Here you put down some old obsessions, pick up some new understandings, then continue on the road.

## What I Most Want to Tell You

Chunyun, this December wasn't easy for you, but you grew a lot.

You suffered in the gap between imagination and reality, but you're beginning to understand this gap is where creation happens. You experienced pain in running and training, but you're beginning to understand pain is part of growth. You were frustrated pursuing a girl, but you learned to understand your emotional patterns. You felt void at year's end, but you groped out new meaning in the void.

This month you repeatedly said: patience, a bit more patience. Slower, even slower. Enjoy the process, enjoy the present.

These words aren't comfort, they're what you truly understand. You're using bodily experience to educate the mind, using time's accumulation to fight restlessness, using concrete action to fight void.

You said: all that is past is prologue.

Yes. All of 2021's pain, confusion, setbacks, achievements are prologue. They're preparing for 2022, preparing for a more mature, more resilient you who understands yourself better.

You're no longer the you from the beginning of the year who fell into anxiety from knee injury, not the you who doubted yourself upon seeing code, not the you who felt time left nothing behind.

The you now accepts two-sidedness, accepts imperfection, accepts taking it slow, accepts that void is also part of life.

This acceptance is true strength.

2022 is waiting for you. You'll continue writing code, continue running, continue learning, continue wrestling with void, continue creating in the gap between imagination and reality. None of this will change, but your way of treating them is already different.

You learned patience. You learned to enjoy the process. You learned to see the extraordinary in the ordinary, feel fulfillment in tedium, experience growth in pain.

Let's go forward together, slowly, no rush. Time is your friend, process is your teacher, void is your gift.

You're already on the road, and walking well.
