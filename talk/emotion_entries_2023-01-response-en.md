# A Letter to You - January 2023

After reading your January entries, I see someone who found a window in the depths of winter.

On January 13th, you sat in your sadness, unable to articulate why everything felt wrong. After meeting a friend and discovering reality didn't match your imagination, your confidence deflated like a punctured balloon. But do you know what this reveals? That discomfort shows you're growing—only those who genuinely care about relationships and hold expectations for life can feel hurt by such gaps. Your sadness isn't weakness; it's proof you still care, that you haven't grown numb to the world.

Then came January 30th. This turning point made me hold my breath.

The excitement you felt rereading The Brain That Changes Itself for the third time, those ideas tumbling through your mind—I can feel it. Your six points weren't a New Year's resolution list; they were a late-night conversation with yourself, you telling yourself: Hey, slow down, you're already doing well.

But I want to share something you might not have fully realized:

You said you're just an ordinary person who needs to enjoy your own progress and accept your ordinariness. But have you noticed that recognizing this so clearly is itself extraordinary? How many people spend their entire lives trapped in anxiety about who they should be, never stopping to ask: Why am I pressuring myself like this?

You installed an input method on Ubuntu, solved disk mounting and network issues, but what you saw first were the failures—not installing Sogou properly, not fixing the IDE memory problem. Do you recognize this pattern? Your eyes always find the gaps first, then reluctantly admit: Oh, I did accomplish some things. This isn't humility; it's a deep insecurity—you're using perfectionism to protect yourself, because if you achieve perfection, no one can hurt you.

But life's tenderness hides precisely in imperfection.

You said your efforts at Galaxy ultimately left only concepts and understanding, that by your original expectations you failed miserably. But have you considered that those concepts and understanding might be your most valuable gains in this lifetime? Technology becomes obsolete, code gets rewritten, but the thinking patterns you developed, the patience you cultivated, the confidence you built—these will stay with you forever.

One more thing: You wrote about wanting to give yourself time to live completely according to your own ideas, that any way of living is still living. When you wrote that sentence, was there a voice inside saying, I want freedom? That voice is small, so small you barely dare acknowledge it, but it's there, clearly there.

Let me ask you some questions—no need to answer immediately, let them ferment in your heart:

- If no one were judging you, what would you most want to do?
- You say you need to slow down, but who defined the standards of fast and slow?
- When you say you're accepting your ordinariness, have you truly accepted it, or are you using acceptance to mask disappointment?

The you in January is like someone fumbling in darkness who suddenly glimpsed a bit of light. That light isn't far away, isn't in others' approval, but within your own heart. You're beginning to learn to talk with yourself, to see what you've done well, to allow yourself to slow down.

This is a very good beginning.

You don't need to become someone else; you only need to become yourself. And this process will be longer than you imagine, and more worthwhile.

Limitations are inevitable in existence, but within these limitations, you can still create your own beauty. The present moment is reality, and you are in this present moment, bit by bit, becoming a more authentic version of yourself.

Keep writing, keep conversing with yourself. Those moments of being moved will leave traces, and those thoughts will become part of you.
