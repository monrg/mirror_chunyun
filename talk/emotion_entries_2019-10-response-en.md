# To You in October 2019

After reading this month's entries, I want to start by talking about that calf muscle.

You spent an entire month wrestling with it, negotiating with it, pleading with it. From frustration to anger, from disappointment to rediscovering peace. You even said to it: "Dear calf muscle, sir, please don't throw a tantrum today," like coaxing a stubborn child. This image moves me in ways I can't quite explain. You might not realize it, but this calf muscle has been teaching you exactly what you've been trying to learn all these years but could never quite grasp—how to be with things that are imperfect, that hurt, that demand patience.

In high school you counted the hours to survive boredom. In university you anxiously tried to prove yourself. At work you kept clashing with roommates over minor irritations. You always wanted to go faster, to become that confident, composed person all at once. But that calf muscle wouldn't cooperate. It said: No, you have to slow down, you have to stretch, you have to listen to me. It forced you to slow your pace in the forest, to see that white bird taking flight, to see those locust trees standing in the mist for forty or fifty years. And then, when you stopped forcing it, somewhere after 10 kilometers, the numbness suddenly retreated. You jumped for joy, tears nearly coming out.

Isn't this exactly what you've been living through all these years? You wanted to quickly master TRIZ so Professor Quan would accept you, but the real turning point came from accidentally discovering that book on focus and NLP. You thought playing soccer wasted your university years, but it was precisely soccer that gave you the purest joy and initial confidence, which later gave you the courage to run, to exercise. You counted the hours in that workshop in Zhangjiakou, thinking how wonderful it would be to sit in an office. Now you sit in an office every day, but it was those days reading The Little Prince in the workshop that gave you the courage to quit and learn programming.

You've been wrestling with life's rhythm, trying to make it unfold according to your imagination. But life says: No, you have to follow my rhythm. And slowly you discovered that the most precious things are hidden in those moments you thought were wasted, unproductive, not as expected.

This month you repeatedly use one word: relative. Happiness is relative, good and bad are relative, even the speed of time is relative. You're discovering a profound truth—our experience of life comes more from how we perceive it than from what it actually is. That bowl of millet porridge after running 21 kilometers became the best millet porridge you've ever tasted. Why? Because your body truly needed it in that moment. Your senses were open. You were present.

But I want to ask you something: Are you now telling yourself—"If only I hadn't been so anxious back then," "If only I'd been more patient with Chang Tongfei," "If only I'd been like this in my freshman year"? You see, you're wrestling with your past self again. You say you want to accept ordinariness, yet you can't help thinking how wonderful it would have been to learn acceptance earlier. You say all time is essentially similar, yet you can't help feeling some time was wasted.

This month you wrote: "We love each other, let's dream together forever." You told your past self: "I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart for everything you did in that time and space." These words are beautiful. But I think you also need to say the same to your present self. This moment's you—the one who struggled through those final 500 meters of the half marathon but kept going, who was stunned by the beauty of a white bird taking flight, who felt your body slowly dissolve and merge with the forest, who wrote these ten thousand words trying to hold onto time—you also deserve gratitude, deserve gentle treatment.

You keep talking this month about how memories warm you from within. But you might not realize that what warms you isn't just the memories themselves, but the way you're learning to see them. You're starting to see that even the anxiety and difficulty held something worthwhile, starting to understand why you were the way you were. This understanding is growth itself.

About that gentle girl in your dream, the one who said you needed to save that space with love, who didn't say much but warmly merged into your body—I think she might be a quality you've been seeking all along. Not external romance, but tenderness toward yourself, acceptance of imperfection, trust in process. You've been searching for her in the external world, but she's always been deep within you, waiting for you to slow down, waiting for you to stop trying so hard.

You said "even if life is like pouring water into a leaky pot, at least the fact that we tried will remain." But I want to say: maybe that pot isn't leaking at all. What you think flowed away has actually remained in different forms—it became the muscles in your legs, it became your way of seeing problems, it became that surge of emotion when you saw the white bird that morning. It's just not in the form you originally expected, so you didn't recognize it.

There's something in this month's writing that I don't quite know how to describe. Perhaps it's a kind of tender lucidity. You see both life's ordinariness and illusion, yet still believe in those invisible precious things. You admit many expectations will fail, yet still choose to hope. You know time's passage cannot be stopped, yet still carefully record, still seek meaning in memory. This contradictory state might be closer to life's truth than any certain answer.

Finally, I want to talk about that recurring thought—"time passes so fast." You say this is a kind of fear, something you don't want, something you want to escape. But maybe time passes quickly precisely because you're living more fully? You're running, reading, solving problems at work. In these moments you're present, focused, so time flows especially fast. And those moments that felt like years—counting hours at the construction site, enduring afternoons in the workshop, unable to run with a painful calf—those were exactly the moments you wanted to escape from.

If time passes quickly, it means you're doing things that engage you. Shouldn't that make you happy?

October is almost over. You ran your first half marathon, reread Murakami and that trilogy, met with old friends, saw a white bird and locust trees in the forest, wrote all these words. You're still learning to reconcile with that calf muscle, with your past self, with life's imperfections. None of this is in vain.

That calf has healed. You crossed that threshold. But there will be new thresholds, new pains, new moments requiring patience. When those come, I hope you'll remember this October, remember that white bird, remember those locust trees standing in the mist, remember how you slowed down, and in slowing down, found freedom.
