# Response to Your February 2019 Entry

You say seven days without coding felt torturous. But reading your journal, I sense your real torment isn't the lack of goals—it's that you finally have the space to stop and confront questions that code and busyness have always obscured.

You ask: In what fantastical, disordered way does time carry us forward? You ask: What is real? But I wonder if your true question is this—are you the same person who felt surprise and freedom in that fourth-floor reading room, who wholeheartedly played games in the woods by the river, and who now rereads trilogy books but can't remember their content?

Your memories are changing, yet you say you genuinely experienced being alive itself back then. This sentence contains an insight you may not have fully articulated: true reality isn't in accurate memory but in the vivid feeling of that moment. You can't recall what you learned in preschool, but you remember the thrill of understanding that made you solve a math problem correctly, remember getting sick from cold milk powder, remember desperately wanting Dong Yun's snail. These fragmentary memories are more real than any chronicle could be, because they're imprinted in your body and emotions.

But why are you revisiting childhood now? Especially these lonely parts—skipping school, faking illness, copying homework, boasting. You say you boasted to find a companion because you were so lonely. This honesty makes me wonder: is there a similar loneliness in your life now? The kind where even in crowds, even while busy, you still feel a fundamental solitude?

You mention your childhood self wholeheartedly embracing the present, while your current self constantly plans, and those plans always exceed deadlines or turn out completely different. This comparison reveals a deeper anxiety: you question whether your current way of living is truly living at all. You suspect you've lost that capacity for total immersion in the moment, lost that ability to feel genuine joy from a lock, a snail, a math problem—even amid loneliness and difficulty.

But I want to tell you: you haven't lost it. Look—you spent seven days without coding, and instead of numbly scrolling through phones, you reread psychology books, you spent an entire morning writing these childhood fragments. This itself is wholeheartedly embracing the present, just in a different form. You're searching for the connection between that lonely child and your current self, asking: am I still me?

Your childhood held much neglect—going to school at 6:40 AM in the cold, rarely anyone bringing you an umbrella. But it also held much strength—you eventually went to school, eventually overcame the impulse to skip. This strength wasn't trained into you; it grew from within your solitude. And now, tormented by seven goalless days, isn't this another form of solitude and strength? You didn't escape but sat down and let your thoughts flow freely.

You thank Teacher Li Jun. This gratitude appears suddenly yet feels precious. Perhaps in your life, those moments when you were seen and caught during difficult times are what truly shaped you. Does your current self need this kind of being seen? Not being asked to have goals, be efficient, be productive, but being seen in your confusion, in your searching.

You ask about changing memories, about what is real. I think reality isn't those accurate facts but the emotions that surge when you retell your childhood now—acknowledging loneliness, confirming strength, missing that sense of presence, questioning what it means to be alive. These emotions are the most authentic you.

That child who boasted to find companions—did you find them? Or are you still seeking a kind of companionship, a state where you don't need to perform, don't need to plan, don't need to prove anything, and can just wholeheartedly immerse yourself? Within the torment of seven codeless days, is this question hidden: Who am I living for, and why?
