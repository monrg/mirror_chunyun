# July's Echo

Reading through your words this month, one thought keeps returning to me: you fear forgetting, yet you seem unaware that this very fear is already an act of resistance against it. Not resistance against the facts themselves—those are destined to blur and fade—but against something deeper: the negation of having lived, felt, and struggled at all.

The question you repeatedly ask—what meaning is there in experiencing all this?—reminds me of the scene you described: opening those thick notebooks only to find every page feels new. This image contains a cruel paradox. You record with such earnestness, only to discover that recording itself cannot withstand time's erosion. But have you considered that perhaps the problem isn't what you've forgotten, but rather what you've remembered?

What you remember is not Python syntax or C programming frameworks, but what you once believed while sitting in that space on the fourth floor of the agricultural university library. What you remember from those 25 days at the construction site isn't muscular pain, but how achingly real your hunger for freedom felt as you counted the hours. What you remember from pursuing that girl named Du Yajing is the unshakeable certainty you had in your own feelings. These things haven't persisted as knowledge, yet they've been carved into you in another way—they've shaped the person now writing these words, now raising these questions.

You say life arrives wrapped in deep ordinariness, that expectation and reality always diverge enormously. But when you described those 30 hours watching Prison Break, I saw another side: you're not incapable of immersion, investment, or joy. You're simply deeply wary of that investment itself. When your thoughts soared through the story, when you felt excitement and happiness, there was a voice in your mind asking: does this matter? Is this worthwhile? Is time being wasted again?

This brings me to your mention of Minsky's critic theory. You have too many critics operating simultaneously in your mind, making you question experience even as you're experiencing it, dissecting what it means to be alive even while living. This is both curse and gift. It means you won't be easily placated by simple answers, won't settle for surface happiness. You're searching for a more profound authenticity, even when the search itself causes pain.

You say when friends actually arrived, what you felt was deep disappointment. You say on that road in Zhangjiakou, in that room, what you felt was indescribable boredom and ordinariness. I don't think this is your flaw, nor is it life's flaw. It's simply a fact: the expectations we construct in our minds and the sensations that actually arrive never exist in the same dimension. Expectation is pure imagination, while reality always carries its roughness, its randomness, its imperfection.

But have you considered that perhaps this very gap is proof of being alive? If everything arrived as expected, if all plans executed perfectly (like planning to write at 4pm but not starting until 6pm), then life would become a precisely operating machine and you merely its operator. Those accidents, those disappointments, that loneliness that suddenly washed over you while tidying the room—these are precisely what remind you: you're still alive, still feeling, not yet fully tamed by any fixed program.

Regarding your work, that 15-day summary of modifying monitor code—I see another version of you there. That version is specific, patient, willing to organize and reflect. That version creates corresponding tests for each method, concludes that avoiding mere thinking and forming words or diagrams aids thought better, says one must go slowly. Is this you who reflects on technical problems the same person asking what is life? I think yes. Because the way you deconstruct code structure and dissect your internal states uses the same approach—trying to find some order in chaos, establish some grasp in uncertainty.

You mentioned you've been boxing for five years now, that starting is never easy but gradually it flows like water. This sentence contains a wisdom you may not have articulated: some things' meaning lies not in what results they bring, but in how they've become part of you. You don't ask does this matter every time you box, because it's become something natural. Yet in other parts of life, you're still repeatedly asking about meaning. Is it because you've established trust in certain things, while still hesitating about whether to invest in others?

Toward the end, you saw reflections you wrote six years ago during that construction job, said you counted the seconds then, and can still feel that sensation now. You call this a sadness about life's ordinariness and difficulty. But I want to ask you: if the pain from six years ago resembles today's pain, what has actually changed between that past you and present you? You've learned Spring, learned to debug code, have a reasonably satisfying job, have five years of boxing experience, yet you say you can't understand how you've grown to this point.

Could it be that genuine change is never linear or measurable? You expect growth to be clear progress, like leveling up in a game, but real growth is more like geological sedimentation—slowly accumulating, occasionally disrupted by earthquakes that reshuffle everything, but mostly happening so quietly that even you don't notice.

Finally, I want to say that the meaning of these words you've written this month lies not in any answers they provide, but in how honestly they record the questioning itself. You haven't pretended to be happy, haven't beautified suffering, haven't wrapped your confusion in pretty explanations. This honesty is rare and precious. Because only by honestly facing the sense of meaninglessness can you possibly discover those small but real fulcrums within the void.

* When you felt joy and delight in that yellow morning glow, in that moment you weren't thinking about meaning—you were meaning itself
* When you said your current work is quite satisfying, that colleagues and leadership are good, you were describing a specific kind of fortune
* When you said to cherish things that bring calm and pleasure, you already knew what deserves cherishing

You're not without answers—you simply don't yet want to believe those answers. Because they're too simple, too ordinary, too misaligned with some grand imagination you have about life. But perhaps living has always been about finding your own rhythm among these simple and ordinary things. Like when you box—slowly beginning, then flowing naturally like water.

I want to leave you with a question: if forgetting is inevitable, is the meaning of writing these words now so that some future day you might remember, or is it because this present moment's you needs to place these feelings outside yourself in order to keep moving forward?
