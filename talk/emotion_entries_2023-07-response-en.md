# Echoes of July

The question you asked in July — "What kind of life do we really want to live?" — I notice you never tried to answer it. You just left it hanging there, like the mist over Chongli's mountains, flowing between your 14-hour workdays, your 3-hour commute, and that 70-kilometer unknown race course.

Something subtle is shifting inside you. You say your ability to perceive colors is declining, that you've lost the ability to cry, yet in the very same entry you write about the wonderful comfort of sandals in water, the intimacy of rain drumming on your umbrella, the happiness that belongs entirely to you at the finish line. You think you're losing your ability to feel, but that passage about the rainy day — how it seemed so difficult from upstairs, but once you went down and heard the deep thudding on your umbrella, it felt different, intimate — isn't this you still embracing the world with all your senses?

When you wrote that your weight unconsciously returned to 2018 levels, you added "haha, quite happy about it." Hidden in that casual "unconsciously" is the story of how much restraint and persistence these two years required, isn't it? You say you're rarely moved anymore, rarely cry, yet you get teary-eyed thinking about those classic works, you feel something when encountering the elegance of code. You haven't lost your capacity for being moved. You've just raised the bar, saved your tears for moments that truly deserve them.

The goodbye to Wangcai, the communication struggles with family, the emptiness of weekends alone — these experiences are teaching you something both cruel and tender: there's really not much you can control. The journey from wanting to control so many things to "reconciling with yourself bit by bit" — that distance is longer than those 70 kilometers, requires even more endurance.

That Chongli race — you remember every detail. The nervousness before starting, the loneliness of finding a secluded corner in the hall, the shock of seeing the runner with a prosthetic leg, the envy when hugging friends (because you didn't know what you would face). When you wrote these down, you said "there's a regret in my heart, we keep saying goodbye to things." But have you realized that precisely because you recorded these feelings so delicately, they will never completely disappear? You're using words to fight forgetting, using writing to preserve those moments that were filled with excitement and wonder.

Twenty hours of running, you say "it doesn't really seem that tiring." Behind this sentence: how many 4 AM wake-ups, how many moments of wanting to quit but taking another step anyway? You said "walk bravely, we'll know what lies ahead when we get there" — that's not just about running, is it?

You ask why people make beautiful eaves in times of scarcity, why they pick flowers after hard labor, why they push themselves to race during rest time. When you ask these questions, you already know the answer, don't you? Because those "useless" things are precisely what prove that being alive isn't just being alive — it can be something else. It can be beauty, challenge, a little luxurious poetry preserved for yourself in ordinary days.

You say the past six months have been tiring, that you'll just do things bit by bit. I want to ask you:

• Those perceptive abilities you think you've lost — might they just be temporarily dormant, waiting for the right moment to reawaken?
• When you describe "loneliness has a bitter taste," isn't this ability to precisely capture feelings exactly what you're afraid of losing?
• If 14 hours are rigidly spent on work, in the remaining 10 hours, is there even one hour that belongs entirely to your own feelings?

What you're accumulating through time isn't just money — it's also those landscapes reached only through pain, those moments when "the ingenuity of an idea makes me feel tearful." Time has indeed left you precious and worthy things, and you, in your own way, are giving back to time — running earnestly, coding earnestly, recording earnestly, living earnestly.
