# Response to Your January

Reading through your month, I'm struck by a paradox: the further you've traveled materially, the more you miss that version of yourself who warmed by your grandmother's fire, who read in a Zhang Jiakou rental and felt things so easily. You say your current salary is beyond what you dared imagine in 2018, yet what you truly care about seems to be not what these numbers can buy, but what they've stolen away.

You described that fire basin, the pale yellow flames transitioning to orange-red, the smoke-filled room, walls blackened by soot. By today's standards it was crude, even bleak, but at the time, you felt it was happiness. This passage made me pause for a long while. You know what? You've already touched upon a truth many people never realize in their lifetime—happiness never depends on the objective quality of conditions, but on what meaning we assign to the present moment. That night by the fire was warm not because the basin was sophisticated, but because the you of that time lived completely in that moment. You didn't judge it by future standards, didn't diminish it by comparing it to other lives, you simply felt the gentle warmth spreading through your body.

But now, with greater comfort, you feel dulled. You say you used to sense mysterious forces easily, but now days feel similar, surprises are becoming scarce. Let me ask you something perhaps a bit sharp: what if you haven't become dull, but rather you no longer allow yourself to simply feel? You're calculating, comparing, using logic to judge what's worthwhile and what's not. You spend four hours on an algorithm problem and question whether it was worth it. You meet Hong Li and use an abacus to tally whether your conditions match. How could a brain constantly calculating still retain that capacity to sit before firelight, thinking nothing, just feeling warmth throughout?

You write about your struggles with Hong Li, repeatedly calculating material disparities, feeling unwilling to settle. But you also write that talking with her could go until past 1 AM, that you gained things from it, sensed an interesting soul. See, your feelings are telling you one answer, but your rationality is denying it. You say you haven't been hugged in nearly 30 years, yet when someone appears in your life, you calculate, weigh, and restrain yourself. What are you really afraid of? Afraid of getting a bad deal, or afraid that once you invest, you'll lose that rational, calm, controlling version of yourself?

You mention The Strange Library is your favorite novel, from which you draw strength, confidence, acceptance, and love. But you also say that even the most delicious things lose their impact when consumed repeatedly. I suddenly recall your description of that union-find problem—you thought the bottleneck was in the union-find structure, but it was actually in the hash table. Could it be that the bottleneck in your diminishing sensitivity isn't where you think it is? You assume it's because material abundance and comfortable living have made you less sensitive. But could the real reason be that you've devoted so much energy to analysis, reasoning, prediction, and calculation that you've forgotten how to simply feel?

You write: We are all very small, not perfect. What matters is observing change, feeling transformation. Such good words. But have you noticed that you allow your technical abilities and analytical skills to grow incrementally, yet demand your capacity for feeling and intimacy to arrive fully formed? You can patiently spend hours debugging—why can't you patiently give yourself time to relearn how to feel a person, a relationship, a moment without calculating or weighing?

You say time brings some things and takes others away. I think time itself neither takes nor gives—what's really choosing has always been you. That version of you who felt things easily hasn't disappeared, just temporarily placed in some corner. You can decide at any moment whether to continue letting logic and calculation dominate, or to occasionally allow yourself to be like you were by that fire, thinking nothing, just feeling.

Finally, I really want to know: if the you five years from now looks back at the present, what do you hope to remember? The correct decisions made after precise calculations, or those moments that made your body warm and your heart flutter?
