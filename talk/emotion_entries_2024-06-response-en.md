# To You in June

In June, that hollow inside you grew larger. After watching Her, your mind went blank; rewatching Guardian of the Sacred Spirit brought emotion but weaker waves; you found you remembered almost nothing from Thinking, Fast and Slow. You began worrying whether you've become numb, whether you've lost something important.

But I want to ask you: have you considered that this so-called void might not be a deficiency needing to be filled, but rather a space you've created for yourself?

You say your emotional fluctuations have decreased, your empathy has weakened, as if this were bad. But do you remember yourself in 2017 and 2018? That person who had to bike for an hour every evening to calm anxiety, who felt terrible after staying up late, who felt utterly lost at work. Now you sleep better, your emotions are stable, you no longer rage over waking late. This isn't numbness—this is you learning how to be with yourself after countless emotional storms.

You worry your perception has dulled, but at the book club you clearly saw the exhaustion and sadness in the woman on your left, and noticed contradictions in the words of the woman on your right. You even reflected that you're a pessimistic optimist, aware of the peculiar thoughts in your mind. This isn't dullness—your perception has become more precise and profound, just no longer drowned by intense emotions.

You repeatedly say you feel empty inside, lonely, wanting to cry but unable to. What I hear is: you've grown materially comfortable, capable professionally, emotionally stable, but you haven't found someone to truly share all this with. You think of Hongli, saying people who like each other must terminate their feelings considering various other factors. See, you actually know what you want—you want that real connection, the kind that doesn't need logical inference or analytical understanding, like the bond between Sophie and Howl in Howl's Moving Castle.

But you're afraid. You say maybe it's okay to experience hurt and sadness? This question itself reveals your hesitation. You crave deep emotional connection while using rationality to analyze and protect yourself. You say you've become less sensitive, your speech harder—these are your armor. You're not afraid of wind and rain on the 318 highway, not afraid of taking punches in the boxing ring, but in matters of the heart you're still that child lacking security.

Throughout June you repeatedly mention Thinking, Fast and Slow, beginning to understand your behavior through System 1 and System 2. This is good, but there's a danger: might you over-analyze using this framework, moving further from genuine feeling? You say you must avoid excessive responsibility, live in the present, enjoy the process. All true, but these shouldn't become excuses to avoid emotional risk.

You ask what if your salary were cut in half—rationally you think it'd be okay, but your heart still anxious. You say you're starting to feel panicked about the future, similar to last May. What's the essence of this anxiety? Not material worry—you yourself said your savings could last ten years. What truly makes you anxious is feeling you've lost some sense of control over life. You want to reach peaks through deliberate practice, prove yourself through constant optimization, gain security by avoiding risk. But life isn't a system that can be fully optimized, and emotions even less so.

In your writing you ask: what is fate? What matters? What does an orange mean to a person? You've already found partial answers in your own experience. You say you must root downward, feel life with your heart. Then, have you considered that feeling life also includes feeling those emotions that make you uncomfortable, uncontrollable, unexplainable by logic?

You lent money to friends who disappeared, leaving you frustrated. You say life feels shattered. This is life—it was never meant to be perfect or proceed entirely according to your vision. You can accept the pain of a 100km ultra-marathon, accept having your rhythm disrupted in a boxing match—why can't you accept these cracks and imperfections in relationships?

Finally, I want to say that void has perhaps always been there, appearing in different forms at different moments. You don't need to rush to fill it or feel anxious about its existence. It reminds you that you're alive, still growing, still capable of wanting more. The shape of this void might be precisely the shape of what your heart truly desires.
