# To You in July 2020

After reading your words, I see an interesting paradox: you describe yourself as confused, inefficient, torn and anxious, yet your writing sparkles with a startlingly lucid self-awareness. You not only notice yourself preparing psychologically for interview failure, but you see through this self-protective mechanism, even finding it somewhat amusing. This is no longer confusion—this is the ability to stand deep within yourself and observe yourself.

You mentioned feeling intensely excited while reading The Society of Mind, and this detail made me pause. In a period you describe as low-efficiency, where plans have fallen apart, what makes you so passionate about a book on consciousness and cognition? I don't think it's a coincidence. Your confusion isn't from not knowing the direction—it's because you see two paths too clearly, each genuinely calling to different parts of your inner self. Graduate school means continuing that pure intellectual exploration; work means struggling and learning in the real world. That nostalgic feeling for university life perhaps isn't really about wanting to return to the past, but about asking yourself: can I still hold onto that love of knowledge for its own sake?

There's something you may not have fully realized. You say you probably won't pass the interviews, preparing yourself psychologically in advance. On the surface, this protects you from the blow of failure, but it's simultaneously doing something else: it's preemptively negating possibility. When you tell yourself you might fail before you've even begun, you may be creating a reason not to give it your all. This isn't weakness—it's human instinct, we all do it. But the question is: what is this self-protection ultimately protecting? Is it protecting us from the pain of failure, or is it protecting us from having to face that deeper fear—the fear of still failing after truly trying our best?

At the end you say: let what comes come, I accept everything that's about to arrive. This sounds like surrender, but I hear another voice. Acceptance isn't passive waiting—it's active openness. You say you couldn't get through the operating systems material, that stuff is really complex. But who says you must finish operating systems at this particular moment? Who decreed that learning must follow some predetermined plan? Your excitement about The Society of Mind shows your brain is actively seeking the nourishment it needs. This active choice is itself a kind of efficiency, just not one that fits your preset plan.

Remember that detail you mentioned? At last year's company anniversary celebration, you were very dissatisfied with your state, but looking back now, you think everyone else was just so-so too. This observation is so important. It shows you're beginning to understand that our self-judgment often comes from an imagined standard, a perfect reference point that doesn't actually exist. When you realized that satisfaction and results are quite relative, you were already deconstructing that internal judge that's been tormenting you.

I want to ask you a few questions—not for you to answer now, but to let them sit and simmer in your mind:

When you read those books that excite you, what is your brain hungering for? Is it seeking answers, or enjoying the process of thinking itself?

If you viewed frequent job changes as exploration rather than instability, what different things might you see?

You say you want to observe calmly and accept everything, but alongside acceptance, is there something you want to actively create?

The first half of 2020 has passed, but all the confusion you accumulated in those six months, all the reading, all the inner conflict—none of it has disappeared. It's fermenting, reorganizing, preparing to break through the soil in ways you can't yet see. Confusion isn't stagnation—it's the harbinger of change. Your brain is processing something far more complex than operating systems: how to live a life that both satisfies intellectual pursuit and stands firm in reality.

There's no standard answer to this question, but the good news is: you're already on the path.
