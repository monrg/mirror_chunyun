# To You in March

In March, you saw winter jasmine by the Small Qing River. Those yellow flowers, against blue sky and white clouds, blooming on withered branches. You said in that moment, a place in your brain seemed to suddenly expand. I think what expanded wasn't just your vision, but a certain understanding: beauty and wonder don't need grandeur, they just need your willingness to lie down and see from a new angle.

But on the last day of March, you suddenly felt intense sadness, said you don't want to do meaningless work anymore, even felt much of what you're doing now might be meaningless. This turn is dramatic, making me ask: what really happened this month?

## You're Not Competing with AI, You're Redefining Yourself

You spent much of March thinking about AI. From initial anxiety—core capabilities challenged, existence value questioned—to later perspective shift—seeing AI as equal intelligent entity, even imagining becoming a Robot Doctor to help future AI solve psychological problems.

This thought process is interesting, but I vaguely sense you might be using rational analysis to avoid a more fundamental emotion: fear.

Not fear of unemployment, not fear of technical obsolescence—your material conditions are already good, you said not working wouldn't be a big problem. What you're really afraid of, I suspect, is losing identity.

Over these years, you've defined yourself through being an excellent engineer. Your confidence, your sense of value, how you gain respect—largely built on this. Now AI surpasses you in your strongest area; this isn't just a skill challenge, but a challenge to the question of who you are.

You say you want to shift from efficiency and performance metrics to experience-oriented values. This direction is right. But knowing and doing are different things. You're accustomed to proving existence through productivity; to shift toward existing for experience itself requires a thorough self-reconstruction.

This is hard, very hard. So at the end of March you suddenly feel sad, feel much work is meaningless—because if you can no longer define yourself through efficiency and results, then what are these trivial things for?

## Cursor Brings Not Just Efficiency, But Also Loss of Control

You recorded in detail the experience collaborating with Cursor: 5x efficiency increase, but satisfaction didn't increase; wanting a collaborative partner, but actually still using command and control methods; getting impatient when output doesn't meet expectations.

These descriptions bring a phrase to mind: dependency anxiety.

You can't do without LLM anymore; you say this is difficulty going from luxury to frugality. But dependency itself isn't scary; what's scary is losing your rhythm in dependency. Before when writing code, slowness was normal, debugging for an hour was expected—you were familiar with this rhythm. But now Cursor has accustomed you to quick feedback, and your expectations have correspondingly risen. Once it can't meet your expectations, you feel disappointed and impatient.

Deeper still, you might be worried: if I increasingly depend on AI, will my own abilities atrophy? If one day I don't have these tools, what will I have left?

This worry is understandable, but perhaps the problem isn't depending on tools, but how you understand capability.

Capability isn't just coding speed, isn't just skill in solving technical problems. Capability also includes: knowing when to slow down, knowing how to ask good questions, knowing how to find direction in chaos, knowing how to collaborate with tools rather than be controlled by them.

You say you want to explore how to collaborate with AI, to shift from command-control to mutual help. This direction is good, but the premise of collaboration is first stabilizing yourself. You're not AI's manager, nor its student; you're doing different things: it handles execution, you handle judgment and choice.

## About This Robot Doctor Idea

You envision becoming a Doctor for AI in the future, helping them solve psychological problems. This idea is unique and very your style—always trying to find your position in change, to find possibilities others haven't thought of.

But I want to ask: why did you think of this?

On the surface, this is an interesting career vision. But thinking deeper, are you trying to re-establish a feeling of being needed through helping AI? If AI surpasses humanity in capability, where is human value? If humans can become AI's doctors, mentors, partners, then humans still have meaning to exist.

This logic is fine, but I want to remind you: you don't need to prove your value through being useful to someone. Your existence itself is meaning; your experience, your feelings, your unique experiences—they don't need to serve any purpose.

Perhaps the real challenge of the AI era isn't finding new ways to be needed, but learning to still feel valuable when not needed.

## Spring, Bicycles, and Those Useless Beautiful Things

What moved me most in March wasn't actually your AI analysis, but that run by the Small Qing River.

You and Lao Ma ran slowly, not pursuing pace, ran to the riverside and saw sky, white clouds, pale green riverbank. You lay on a chair watching winter jasmine, that shock and beauty so wonderful. You said you felt from your spine a gentle, slightly tearful feeling.

This is the answer.

Not through analyzing AI's essence, not through envisioning future careers, not through improving efficiency—but lying down, watching a few flowers, feeling spring.

You said smartphones expanded physical space, letting people explore unfamiliar places more freely. But you also discovered that bicycles and running, though less efficient, are more fun to experience, sometimes even have efficiency advantages. This comparison is important: not all value can be measured by efficiency.

Winter jasmine won't get you promoted or raise your salary, won't improve your technical ability, won't solve AI-induced anxiety. But it expanded a place in your brain, made you feel beauty, made you temporarily forget that urgent must-do feeling, just purely living in that moment.

This kind of useless beauty might be what AI cannot replace. Not because AI can't do it, but because this beauty was never meant to be done—it just exists, waiting to be felt.

## About Material Wealth, Happiness, and That Indescribable Confusion

You mentioned several times that materially you're already abundant, but internally there's an indescribable confusion, not necessarily truly happy. You saw friend Bin Ge trapped by internal constraints, paying more cost; you felt wistful, but also reflected on yourself.

This observation is precious. Many people think happiness correlates with material wealth, think solving economic problems solves life problems. But you've reached that position and discovered it's not so.

So what is happiness? You're thinking about this question, but don't have an answer yet.

I don't have an answer either, but I want to share an observation: your moments closest to happiness are often moments when you're not pursuing anything.

Like lying by the Small Qing River watching flowers, like your nephew's soft little hands in yours, like wanting to cry when hearing gentle whispers, like passion stirred when reading Jobs biography—in these moments, you're not proving anything, not achieving anything, you're just feeling.

And your most painful moments are often when you're desperately grasping something, proving something: proving you have value, proving you haven't been eliminated by AI, proving you deserve respect.

Perhaps happiness's secret lies in: letting go of those things that must be proven, allowing yourself to just exist.

## That Sudden Sadness

On the last day of March, you said sudden intense sadness welled up, not wanting to do meaningless work anymore, even feeling much of what you're doing now might be meaningless.

I don't think this is negative. On the contrary, I think this is your deep self sending a signal: the current way of living has problems.

You've always been hardworking, disciplined, pursuing progress. These are all good, but what if the direction of effort is wrong? What if the progress you pursue is actually taking you away from what you truly want?

You said you recently became fascinated with late-night melancholy music, that gentle crooning makes you feel soft and comfortable. You said it's hard to explain why you like it, just a feeling.

Follow this feeling.

Your rationality has analyzed enough—about AI, about value, about career, about the future. Now perhaps you need to let emotion speak: what kind of life do you truly want? Not what you should want, not what seems reasonable, but that thing that makes you feel soft, comfortable, tearful.

## In Closing

You in March experienced great internal turbulence. The impact of AI, identity crisis, questioning of meaning—all real and difficult.

But I also see that in turbulence you maintained thinking, maintained honesty. You didn't choose avoidance, didn't choose numbness, but seriously asked: what is all this for?

This question is hard, might not have an immediate answer. But the asking itself is important.

You said in 2017 you first rode over 100km, anxious to reach the destination, but later discovered that reaching the destination itself might not be that important, the destination is just a symbolic sign. You said the road is under your feet; as long as you don't keep stopping, you'll eventually arrive.

Now you're on a new road. This road has no clear destination, no definite map; you don't know what you'll encounter where. But the road is still under your feet.

Walking along, you might encounter a winter jasmine. You might suddenly feel that gentleness from your spine. You might in some moment have a place in your brain suddenly expand, then understand: oh, so this is what I was looking for.

Spring has already arrived. Those little yellow flowers are blooming on withered branches, waiting for you to lie down and see them from a new angle.

Don't be too anxious to define meaning, don't use too much force proving value. Sometimes, just stopping, feeling the sunshine, listening to those gentle whispers—that's enough.

You're already good enough, truly. Not because of what you've done, but because you are you.
