# The Weight of August

Reading through this month of your life, I see someone trying to inhabit two worlds at once. In one world, you're still that young person in the library who believed they could create something astonishing. In the other, you face tedious code, glacial progress, and a reality that keeps refusing to match your imagination. These worlds collide inside you almost daily, and you bear the impact of each collision.

You mention repeatedly that you've become harsh, critical like your mother, and this frightens you. But I wonder if you've misunderstood what's happening. Your severity isn't about becoming someone you despise—it's about desperately protecting the person you believe you should be. That person who ought to be exceptional, who ought to create remarkable things. When reality keeps showing you slow progress, when the people around you can't understand your pursuits, criticism becomes your way of proving you still have standards, that you're still reaching for excellence. Of course this hurts others and yourself, but its root isn't malice—it's a kind of desperate loyalty to the dreams you carried when you were younger.

You reread Kafka and Murakami over and over. Five times, six times, you note with something like embarrassment, as if you should be reading new books, learning new things instead. But perhaps it's exactly the opposite. In a world demanding you constantly move forward and improve, you need these old friends to remind you that beauty isn't about novelty—it's about what can still move you. You're not wasting time. You're returning to those familiar words to confirm that what once touched you remains beautiful, to confirm that the person who could be moved still exists somewhere inside you. As everything grows more rational and utilitarian, rereading is how you stay soft.

In August, your knee finally healed. You mention this almost casually, but I see a deeper metaphor. Seven months of waiting, far longer than you expected. You thought it would be faster. But it did heal, just on its own timeline, not yours. Your whole life seems to follow this same pattern: slower than imagined, more ordinary than hoped for, but actually happening. You say you're too impatient—you've said this many times—but isn't the impatience itself proof of your aliveness? If you truly didn't care, how could you be impatient?

So many childhood fragments surface this month: falling while tending sheep and receiving scolding instead of comfort, watching other children play at the amusement park from outside, the grasshopper cage your father made, your fear when herding cattle alone in winter. These memories didn't appear randomly in August. The loneliness you feel now, the pain of wanting to be seen but not understood—this is the same person as that child who fell and waited for comfort but received criticism instead. You learned to be strong, to handle everything yourself, but the cost was learning not to trust that you'll be treated gently. So you became hard first, preemptively critical, armed with judgment. It's a survival strategy you learned very young.

But August also gave you cracks where light got through. You helped Xiaoming move and glimpsed another way of living. In that moment you felt that what you already have would have been unimaginable before. You talked with your sister for a full hour—unprecedented. You sang karaoke badly but enjoyed the process with ease. These moments are small, barely emphasized in your writing, but they're the real turning points—you're learning how to hold onto ideals without refusing ordinary warmth.

You say you want to create impressive things, to astonish people, but you're completely unclear how. This sentence reveals a secret: you actually know that real creation requires time, accumulation through tedium, accepting your own ordinariness. You're not unclear about how—you're unwilling to accept that greatness demands such a long ordinary journey as payment. What you want is magic, instantaneous transformation, the moment of being seen. What life gives you is three hours debugging, one version of a monitoring program, line after line of code.

After reading about that woman's terrible suffering in the news, you said your stomach felt sick all day. This reaction isn't just empathy for another's pain—it's shock at the world's absurdity. The world you imagined should be orderly, should make sense, but reality keeps showing you its other face. This disillusionment parallels your disillusionment at work: the world doesn't operate how you wish it would, code doesn't elegantly flow as imagined, people don't reward effort with recognition. Accepting this absurdity, accepting what you cannot control—this is the difficult lesson you've been learning all through August.

You keep asking yourself what has value. Behind this question hides a deeper one: who am I, and do I deserve to be seen? Your childhood material scarcity, the school violence you endured, starting independent life at fourteen—all these experiences taught you that you must prove your worth or you don't deserve kindness. So you strain to do prestigious things, to surpass others technically, to gain recognition. But worth isn't proven this way. Your grandfather planting corn, seed by seed, laboriously bringing it home in autumn—did that have no value? You've already glimpsed the answer, you just don't quite believe it yet.

In the last days of August, you started reading Dance Dance Dance, remembering those days working in the workshop in 2017. You were anxious then too, but there was a fullness to it. You say you're losing sensitivity to life, becoming rigid. What you're sensing, I think, is that you're filling life with efficiency and achievement while losing the capacity to be moved by wind, by books, by a single moment. You've become too heavy, weighted with expectations and anxieties, so that lighter things can no longer lift you.

If I could ask you one question: in this August, was there any moment when you forgot who you're supposed to become and simply lived? Was it seeing those early morning cyclists during your ride? The softness in your heart hearing Xijun's voice? The familiar feeling when you operated Ubuntu again? Or those moments reading Murakami when you felt understood? In those moments, you didn't need to prove anything, didn't need to be impressive—you were just breathing, feeling, existing.

Could it be that you're so afraid of becoming ordinary that you can't enjoy the real happiness available in ordinary days? Your dreams deserve pursuing, your ambitions make you distinctive, but perhaps true courage isn't creating astonishing things—it's staying gentle with yourself during the long process of creation, still seeing meaning in your effort and your very existence even when the code is tedious and progress slow.

What August might teach you isn't how to reach your goals faster, but how to keep loving this imperfect version of yourself when you fall short, how to keep finding those small, real moments of beauty in an absurd world that refuses to cooperate with your plans.
