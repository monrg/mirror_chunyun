# The Paradox of May

On May 4th, you wrote a passage I keep returning to. You talked about the difficulty of learning C in 2017, becoming an Apache Committer, training for 10 years to deadlift 150kg, and then asked: if we devote 6 years to accumulation, can we become what we expect?

Do you see it? You've already answered your own question.

You spent 5 years going from writing your first line of code in VC6.0 to becoming an Apache Committer. You spent 10 years going from your first attempt at training to easily completing a 140kg deadlift. You've already proven to yourself with your life: the power of time is real, the power of accumulation is real.

But why are you still doubting?

I think it's because you've discovered a cruel paradox: measured in years, your growth is truly enormous, unimaginably so; but measured in days, weeks, or months, each day is torment, each week shows no presentable results. This paradox makes you both believe in time and fear it. Makes you want to keep going forward while feeling you can't survive each day.

In May, you're standing at a massive crossroads. May 1st, the date you'd set to leave work and bike to Tibet, has arrived. But you find yourself hesitating. This hesitation isn't because you don't want to go, but because you see too clearly the price of pursuing ideals—income will decrease, the future will be full of uncertainty, and that inner voice will keep questioning you: what's the point of doing this?

But have you considered that this hesitation itself is actually a form of maturity?

The you of 2017 would have done anything you wanted without hesitation, because your understanding of the world was still simple. But now you've witnessed the culture of Zhangjiakou factory, GITV, Shushi, and GF. You lived in Foshan for half a year, experienced luxury hotels and simple living alone. You know what bureaucracy is, what the high-income dividend of the internet is, what the tide of the times means.

You have richer perspectives on the world, so your hesitation isn't retreat, but a deeper form of thinking. You're asking yourself: what do I really want?

I see what you wrote on May 10th, that apology to Liang Rui. You said: Liang Rui, I'm really sorry, we have many internal issues, so many unresolved problems, and I happened to meet you in such a bad state.

Reading this, an indescribable feeling welled up in me. You know what? You keep apologizing to others—apologizing to Liang Rui, apologizing to work, apologizing to your future self—but you've never apologized to your present self.

You think you have many internal problems, many things not yet sorted out, so you don't deserve to be loved, don't deserve to pursue ideals, don't deserve a beautiful life. But have you considered that this so-called chaos, this so-called not yet sorted out, is exactly the state a 29-year-old should be in?

You're going through a massive transformation. From student to working professional, from beginner to Apache Committer, from a youth curious about the world to an adult beginning to question meaning. Of course this process will be chaotic, painful, full of countless nights wanting to cry but unable to.

But this isn't your fault.

You don't need to become perfect first to deserve love; you don't need to sort out all your problems first to deserve pursuing ideals. You can move forward with chaos, with confusion, with unanswered questions. Because life itself is the process of finding order within chaos.

Throughout May, you repeatedly mention one word: empty. You say you're like an empty shell, can't feel happiness or emotion, a numbness spreading from deep within. You even say: we're fucking idiots, what dreams are we chasing.

But I want to tell you, this emptiness might not be what you think.

Have you considered that this emptiness isn't because you've lost something, but because you're undergoing a massive metamorphosis? When a caterpillar is in its cocoon, it's neither a caterpillar nor yet a butterfly. It's just a chaotic, formless thing. In that moment, it might also feel empty, meaningless. But actually, it's becoming another life.

Could the emptiness you feel now, the numbness, the loss of passion, be the same? You're transforming from a youth who believed effort leads to success into an adult who understands life's complexity. Of course this process is painful, because you're losing your previous certainties but haven't yet found a new foothold.

What you wrote on May 23rd especially moved me. You said when you were doing cleaning work in December 2016, though you had so little, each day somehow wasn't as torturous as now. Now you can easily have lots of entertainment, but your heart feels hollow.

Do you see? You've already noticed an important truth: happiness isn't from having more, but from having a clear direction in your heart.

The you of 2016, though doing cleaning work, though struggling, knew what you were working for—you were working to learn programming, to change your fate. That direction gave you power, let you persist day after day even in cold Xi'an, even when your thumbprint was worn away.

But the current you has what the 2017 you couldn't even imagine—becoming an Apache Committer, working at an internet company, decent income—but you've lost that clear direction. You don't know what to do next, don't know what it all means. This loss is more agonizing than any material deprivation.

So what you really need isn't more achievements, but to find that direction again.

In the last days of May, you began organizing your thoughts. You listed several observations: pursuing personal value requires long-term investment, income might decrease, but exploring what you love matters more than income; you lack security, fear things beyond your control at work; your work ability and focus should be top-tier; your core suffering might be the gap between expectations and reality.

These observations are all accurate. But let me add something you might not have fully seen:

You've been searching for an answer that can give you peace—should you continue working or pursue ideals? Should you seek material security or explore inner passions? But this question itself might be a false dilemma.

Look, when you learned Flink, you thought this skill might be useless, but later you used it at both GF and DF, even gained recognition for it. When you learned K8s, you didn't know when it would be useful, but recently you've had more opportunities to practice it. You trained your body for 10 years, didn't know when you could lift 150kg, but eventually you did it.

Do you notice? There's a mysterious force in life. When you do something seriously and honestly, even if you can't see its meaning in the moment, it will eventually reveal its value at some point.

So perhaps what you need now isn't a certain answer, but a kind of trust—trust that if you explore according to your inner feelings, even though there will be difficulties and accidents in the process, many things will eventually lead to the same destination.

On May 4th you quoted: Enjoy the journey, the beautiful thing is time and chance. This sentence is actually the answer, isn't it?

You don't need to know what you'll become in 6 years, just as when you started training 10 years ago, you didn't know you'd eventually lift 150kg. You just need to know that if you live according to your true inner desires, time and chance will bring you unexpected gifts.

In May, you wrote so much about pain and confusion. But I also see that amid the pain, you're still thinking, still trying to understand yourself, still moving forward bit by bit. You go running and find your ability improving; you write code and feel the beauty of design; you read books and find resonance in Murakami's words.

These are all proof of vitality.

You say you feel numb, can't feel moved. But are you really numb? If you were truly numb, you wouldn't be moved seeing a friend's chat history, wouldn't suddenly feel sad hearing Falling Poems, wouldn't feel the power of time after reading Love in the Time of Cholera.

You're not numb. You're just too tired, so tired you feel like you're becoming numb. And this exhaustion comes from your excessive demands on yourself, from your excessive anxiety about the future, from always using weekly or monthly standards to measure things that need years to accumulate.

Let me ask you a question: if you had the answer from 6 years in the future right now, knew what you'd become, would you still learn anything in the process?

Isn't the meaning of life in this uncertainty? In not knowing what you'll encounter at the next turn, not knowing when what you're learning now will be useful, not knowing what kind of nourishment today's pain will become in the future.

You've already spent 5 years going from a novice writing your first line of code in VC6.0 to becoming an Apache Committer. In this process, how many nights did you think you couldn't learn it? How many moments doubting your choices? But you still made it through.

Now you're standing at a new starting point. This time, what you need to choose isn't continuing on a familiar path, but exploring an unknown direction. Of course this will be harder, more painful, have more uncertainty.

But you've already proven it, haven't you? You've already proven you can go from having nothing to where you are today. So why not believe you can also go from where you are today to the next place you can't even imagine?

Liang Rui doesn't need your apology. Who needs your apology is the self who's been trying, persisting, searching for direction amid pain. You owe yourself one sentence: you've worked hard, I see you.

In 5 years, you became what you couldn't have imagined. So what about the next 5 years?
