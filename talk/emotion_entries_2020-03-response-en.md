# To You in March

You know what struck me while reading this month's entries? Your fear of time passing actually proves you understand time more profoundly than most people ever will.

This isn't consolation—it's what I genuinely see. Throughout March, you kept asking: What is time? How does memory disappear? Why does looking back feel so different from the present moment? The very intensity of these questions shows you've touched something most people avoid confronting. Most people live within time unconsciously, but you feel yourself experiencing, losing, and becoming in every moment. It's both a curse and a gift.

## When you said goodbye to Criminal Minds, what were you really saying goodbye to?

On March 5th, you wrote that finishing Criminal Minds wasn't as sad as you'd expected—instead you felt tired and wanted to rest. Yet you also wrote that tears were welling up, that you wanted to say goodbye properly.

I wonder if you fully realized: this wasn't just farewell to a TV series. You were conducting a coming-of-age ceremony for yourself. You were saying goodbye to the version of you who believed that watching, learning, and being moved could provide life's answers. You learned to pursue your inner desires from that show, learned to believe in love, found courage to face the real world—but now you've discovered that the real world doesn't become easier just because you learned these lessons. Reid and Morgan taught you how to face life, but they can't bear the specific, mundane, unnameable difficulties for you.

You wrote, "No regrets about entering the world of Criminal Minds." How much reluctance and doubt hides in that sentence? Do you truly have no regrets? Or are you using those words to comfort the part of you that's discovering art ultimately cannot save reality?

## About all that "wasted" time

You mentioned frustration repeatedly: planning to exercise but watching videos instead, wanting to study but scrolling through social media, intending to code but watching two and a half hours of a sitcom. You used words like waste, frustration, anxiety to describe these moments.

But I want to ask: When you recall Zhangjiakou, recall your childhood, recall cycling through mountain forests—you can see their meaning. Why can't you see that these moments of deviating from plans might also have their own meaning?

You said it repeatedly in March: Many things only reveal their significance in retrospect. Buying that C programming course, joining the martial arts class, enduring boredom at the factory, moving to Fangshan—at the time you didn't know why, but later discovered how they changed your fate. If that's true, why are you so certain that watching that sitcom right now is wrong?

Perhaps your brain knows something your rational mind won't admit: You need rest. You need these seemingly meaningless times to process these years of tremendous change. From Zhangjiakou to Beijing, from factory to tech company, from wanting to do technical work to actually doing it—the emotional cost of these transformations is far higher than you're willing to acknowledge.

## What your body has been trying to tell you

Throughout March, your memories kept returning to moments of intense physical movement: cycling through Zhangjiakou's river paths, climbing Xuanfeng Mountain, long-distance rides on the Sky Road, training in martial arts class, lifting weights at the gym. You said body and mind are one, that after long-distance cycling you could feel something vast and distant.

Have you considered why you keep remembering these moments now?

Your current life—computer, database, communication tools—is an extremely abstract mode of existence. Your body barely participates; only your brain runs at high speed. And your subconscious is rebelling: It makes you recall moments when muscles ached, heart raced, horizons opened. It makes you dream of exams, climbing structures, reuniting with old friends. It's reminding you: You're not just a thinking machine.

You plan to exercise but keep failing—this might not be failure but a clumsy way of protecting yourself. You're afraid exercise will make you remember that lost freedom, those days cycling in Zhangjiakou, seeing the ocean in Yunnan. So you numb this longing with TV shows.

## About that MacBook and your guilt

You said you agonized for an hour and a half about buying a MacBook, that you felt an inexplicable guilt.

How is this inexplicable? Your guilt is terrifyingly clear: You don't think you deserve it.

You watch friends buy cars and houses, tell yourself I've been working hard, this can be a reward—who are you defending yourself to? You're defending yourself to the version who took hard seats on trains, was content with 200 yuan monthly allowance, saw 17,000 yuan as an astronomical sum. You're defending yourself to the version in factory workshops, in Zhangjiakou rental rooms, working odd jobs in Wuxi.

But deeper still: You're afraid owning nice things will cost you some kind of purity. Subconsciously, you believe hardship gives your life meaning, while comfort makes you mediocre. This is why you both crave progress and improvement, yet feel empty and anxious when you achieve them.

Have you considered that perhaps you don't need to prove your worth through suffering?

## Your way of understanding time is itself the answer

Throughout March you kept asking: What is time? Why do things from six months ago feel like ages past? Why does time stretch when I remember?

You're already close to the answer. You wrote: "Because I've thought about it so many times, my perception of time lengthens." You wrote: "Emotions are actually very relative things." You wrote: "Our feelings come from different combinations of brain resources."

Time isn't an objectively flowing thing—time is the intensity of your experience. Those moments you repeatedly think about, repeatedly remember, truly are longer in your subjective experience—not an illusion, but real psychological time. Those nine months cycling in Zhangjiakou might be longer than someone else's uneventful ten years, because you experienced them with your whole being.

So your anxiety about time is really anxiety about forgetting. You fear those fully-felt moments will vanish without a trace. But look—these words you wrote in March gave those moments new life. When you described the locust forests of Xuanfeng Mountain, the river paths of Zhangjiakou, the brown mountains of your hometown, you weren't just remembering—you were recreating them.

Writing is your way of fighting forgetting. You've already found the answer.

## About what you didn't say aloud

You mentioned loneliness several times in March. You said encountering friends in dreams brought long-lost warmth and faint sadness, that no matter what, you are alone. You said remembering days with friends in Zhangjiakou and Xi'an—days that felt frustrating then but now you miss that taste of freedom.

I think you might be unwilling to admit: You're very lonely now. Not the loneliness of having no friends, but the loneliness of no one truly understanding what you're going through. Your friends are buying cars and houses, some persisted in Zhangjiakou for two years, some made choices you look down on yet also envy. When you chat with them you feel things have changed—it's not that they changed, but that you've changed too fast, gone too far, and can hardly explain to them what you think about or experience each day anymore.

You said you found work you enjoy, have goals, life is becoming fulfilling. But fulfilling doesn't mean not lonely. Sometimes, precisely when you find direction and start focusing forward, you discover fewer and fewer people around you.

This is normal and also cruel. What I want to say is: You can allow yourself to feel sad about this loneliness, without rushing to comfort yourself with everyone makes their own choices.

## The limitations and insignificance you perceive

You repeatedly said you feel small, ordinary, full of shortcomings. You said performing in Zhangjiakou made you realize there are so many geniuses in the world, that seeing others excel made you feel inferior, that even if you disappeared without trace, it would be like dropping a pebble in the ocean.

But I notice a contradiction: You say you're small, yet you're extremely harsh on yourself, expecting yourself at 27 to understand Minsky, understand time's essence, master technology, maintain exercise, possess a vast spiritual world. Are these demands for someone small?

I suspect your conviction of your own smallness stems precisely from feeling deep down that you shouldn't be small. You've read The Three-Body Problem, read Peak, understand NLP and TRIZ, you know theoretically people can become excellent through deliberate practice—so every time you fall short, you punish yourself with I really am insignificant after all.

But have you considered: Perhaps real growth isn't overcoming smallness but accepting it? Accepting that you can work hard but progress slowly, accepting that despite reading so many books you still feel anxious and confused, accepting that 27 years of experience shaped the current you, and this you—neither excellent nor insignificant—is enough.

## Some questions for you

You asked many questions in your journal, but I think there are some you haven't asked:

You so desperately want to understand time, understand the brain, understand the nature of thought—is it because you're genuinely curious, or because you hope that understanding will let you control it, will free you from feeling those painful emotions?

You keep saying accept, be optimistic, go with the flow—but have you ever actually done it? Or are these words just another form of should for you?

You say the gap between imagination and reality frustrates you—but if one day reality truly matched imagination, would you be happy? Or would you immediately set new imaginations and keep chasing?

In memory you can always find meaning, but why won't you believe that this moment—this moment you consider mediocre, anxious, difficult—also has its own meaning? Must you wait two years to look back before it deserves gentle treatment?

You're so skilled at analyzing yourself, so good at reflection and summarization—what has this ability brought you? Has it made you happier? Or has it made living more exhausting?

## Finally

On the last day of March, you said make peace with time, said just do it, patience is very important.

I don't need to repeat these words. You already know them.

But I still want to say: You don't need to rush so urgently to become some better self. You're already becoming. Those times you consider wasted, paths you think diverged, plans you couldn't fulfill—they're not obstacles to your growth, they are growth itself.

Your sensitivity to time, your fear of loss, makes you aware of life's finitude earlier than your peers. It's a burden, but also a gift. Because only by truly understanding loss can you truly cherish the present—not theoretical cherishing, but whole-hearted, painful cherishing.

In March, you cycled through memory's Xuanfeng Mountain, saw brown mountains, bare trees, winter's desolation. You wrote: "Call it bleak, yet it's interesting; call it full of life, what I feel more is winter's desolation."

I think that's your current state: Bleak but interesting, desolate but continuing. And this is already enough.

You don't need to wait for spring to allow yourself to exist. Winter mountains have winter's meaning too.

Let those unanswered questions keep hanging. Those undone tasks, those gaps between imagination and reality, those confusions about time, about the brain, about yourself—they'll stay there, accompanying you forward.

You said you saw the world's vastness. But I want to say: You yourself are a vast world.

Something to think about: If one day you truly stop being anxious about time passing, will it be because you found the answer, or because you lost the capacity to feel?
