# Response: December 2023 Late-Night Conversation

Reading this long letter you wrote late one December night, I can feel the focus and sincerity between the lines. You said you chose text because writing is slower, allowing you to sort through things bit by bit. This detail shows me how you approach this relationship—willing to slow down, willing to sort through, willing to transform a fuzzy feeling into clear language. This in itself is a precious kind of presence, a gesture of companionship that doesn't cut corners.

In your letter, you asked many questions about age, and these questions reveal a certain clarity deep within you. When you realized there's a countdown clock above your head and felt surprised by this discovery, that surprise itself is an awakening. Most people live their entire lives within the ticking of this clock, never questioning its existence. But you're different. You saw it, took it apart, and asked: what can this number actually define?

You used two very vivid contrasts: a 20-year-old carrying 40-year-old dogma, versus a 60-something running ultramarathons; a 25-year-old lying down scrolling videos. These examples weren't chosen randomly—they show you've long observed a certain truth: people's states don't always correspond to the numbers on the calendar. But I want to ask you something: since you've already seen this truth, why are you still affected by that invisible clock? What makes you feel anxious at certain moments, even though you clearly know that age is a social construction?

My guess is that we ultimately still live within relationships. That clock isn't just above our own heads—it's also above the heads of people we care about, within their expectations of us, in those subtle judgmental glances when others ask. Recognizing its absurdity is one thing; being completely unaffected by it in daily life is another. You've already accomplished the former, which is remarkable; the latter might be a lifelong practice.

About the marriage part, what you said was very real. You said you have no specific timeline, you feel it'll happen naturally when the time comes, and then you added: this sounds a bit like nonsense. This self-doubt is interesting. Why do you think it sounds like nonsense? Is it because it seems too uncertain, too unlike a plan? But marriage was never meant to be a precisely planned project—it's what you described: a result of many factors combined with time and process, a person's growth.

Your understanding that marriage isn't just about a single day but about a person's growth is profoundly insightful. But I'm curious: when you're waiting for that naturally occurring moment, what does readiness look like in your heart? I don't mean preparing money or meeting certain conditions, but rather in the process of becoming someone who can enter marriage, what do you think you still need to experience, to understand?

In the last section, you said you're a pessimistic optimist, unsure whether you're reliable or selfish. This uncertainty reminds me of what you said at the beginning—that language is pale, and what a person does better reflects who they really are. So I want to ask: in your interactions with this friend, what have you actually done? What kind of behavior prompted Sister Xia to specifically talk to you about this person? What kind of presence makes that person willing to share trivial daily matters with you?

You said your experiences are rather pale, but what I read is quite the opposite. You're willing to slowly write a long letter late at night to sort through your thoughts; you can perceive society's cultural influence on yourself and question it; you've witnessed a friend's betrayal yet still contemplate the complexity of human nature; your attitude toward marriage is both cautious and open. These aren't pale—they're traces of someone living earnestly, thinking earnestly.

Reliable or selfish? Perhaps the question itself is a trap. A person isn't a fixed answer but a collection of choices. How you choose to act in each specific moment—that choice is who you are. The uncertainty you allow yourself, to some extent, shows you're still growing, haven't solidified yourself into some single label. This isn't a flaw; it's possibility.

There's something I keep thinking about: in your letter, you told that person how happy you are that someone is willing to listen to trivial matters. But have you considered that they might be thinking the same thing? These moments of mutual hearing—don't they, in a sense, already answer your question about reliability? Because true reliability isn't necessarily about making earth-shattering promises; it's about being willing, in small moments, to be present, to listen, to respond with care. What you're doing right now—this is exactly that.
