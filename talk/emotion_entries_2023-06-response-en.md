# June's Glimmer

On June 14th, you wrote about a moment. Playing with Rosie in the morning, joking with your roommate, you suddenly had a strange feeling, as if you sensed another self—so relaxed and free.

Did you notice this detail?

Throughout June, you kept saying you were like an empty shell, saying you couldn't feel anything, saying you'd become hollow and numb. But even as you were saying these things, Rosie, a roommate, a joke—these suddenly let you feel another self. That relaxed and free self never actually disappeared. It was just buried under too much anxiety and exhaustion.

What does this tell us? It tells us that what you think you've lost has never truly been lost. You're just too tired, so tired you temporarily can't feel it.

In June, you're at a very delicate moment. You say you want to rest but fear having no salary or social security; you say you want to be a waste of space but clearly know that's not what you really want; you say you can't go on, yet you're optimizing code line by line, training bit by bit for a running race.

Do you see this contradiction? Your body and your mind are saying completely different things.

Your mind says: I can't do this anymore, I'm giving up, I'm worthless. But your body says: I'm still continuing to work, I'm still training for running, I'm still improving bit by bit.

Which is the real you?

I think both are. The you who says you can't go on is real, because you really are too tired, really do need rest. But the you who keeps going is also real, because deep inside, there's still a force that won't give up.

What you wrote on June 29th showed me something you might not have fully realized. You said the 40km journey during Dragon Boat Festival let you experience a very thick kind of happiness, that creativity is hidden somewhere in your body, and when you walk there, you see it dwelling there.

This is so important.

The answer you've been looking for, the proof that you're still alive and can still feel beauty, is actually right here. You thought you'd gone numb, thought you could never feel happiness again, but the 40km journey tells you: you still can.

It's just that this happiness isn't light and fluffy, isn't something you can get casually. It requires your whole-hearted commitment, requires you to complete routes you thought you couldn't finish, requires you to discover that creativity dwelling deep within through physical pain.

Isn't this also telling you something else?

For instance, could the hollowness and numbness you feel now be because you haven't done things requiring total commitment for too long? Every day you go to work, handle various trivial problems, cope with various anxieties, but how long has it been since you immersed yourself completely in something like that 40km walk, not thinking about its usefulness, just purely experiencing it?

At the end of June you wrote: these past two days, optimizing code line by line, gradually clarifying previously chaotic logic, now having a deeper understanding of high cohesion and low coupling. If future days could all be like this, focusing on doing things, I'd feel very happy.

You see, when you focus on a concrete thing, when you see things getting better bit by bit, you feel happy. Not superficial joy, but a deep, solid satisfaction.

This is the same principle as that 40km. When you focus on the present, focus on the road beneath your feet, focus on each line of code, you can feel that thick happiness. But when you put your attention on future uncertainty, on bad things that might happen, on various abstract anxieties, you feel hollow and numb.

So perhaps the problem isn't that you've lost the ability to feel happiness, but that your attention is occupied by too many things you can't control.

On June 5th you wrote: recently saw so much negative news, began thinking about what I am, how to live the coming days. Life has so many things beyond control, no confidence at all about the future.

This is very real. Life really does have too many uncontrollable things. But have you considered how much of your anxiety comes from things truly beyond control, and how much comes from your imagination of the future?

You worry that messy things will happen, worry about problems you might encounter, worry about this and that. But have those things actually happened? Or is it just your brain constantly rehearsing various possible bad scenarios, making you experience a hundred times the pain of things that haven't happened yet?

I'm not saying your anxiety isn't real. It's very real, real enough to make your heart uncomfortable, real enough to make you feel you can't go on. But what I want to remind you is: the reality of anxiety doesn't mean the content of anxiety is real.

Most of the things you fear might never happen. And even if they do, they might not be as bad as you imagine. You said it yourself—the worst case is just quitting right now, no big deal.

So what are you really afraid of?

I think you might not fear a specific thing, but rather a feeling of losing control. You fear that without work you won't know what to do; you fear that without salary and social security you'll lose your sense of security; you fear that if you rest, you'll become worthless.

But all these fears are built on one assumption: you need external structure to define your value.

If you don't have work, are you worthless? If you rest, are you a waste? If you don't have a salary, can't you survive?

You know the answer yourself: no. You have friends living on 5000+ yuan a month who got married and had children—any kind of day is still a day. Your material conditions are already quite good; even resting for a year or two to explore wouldn't be a big deal.

So what's really stopping you isn't material conditions, but your definition of yourself. You've tied your value to work, tied your meaning to productivity. So once you think about resting, you feel like you're giving up, escaping, becoming worthless.

But is rest really giving up?

On June 14th you wrote: suddenly realized that resting for a while would also be good. Where did this thought come from? It came from playing with Rosie, joking with roommates, suddenly feeling another self—that relaxed and free self.

That self tells you: you don't need to always be tense, don't need to always prove yourself, don't need to always seek value in productivity and achievement. You can just exist, just breathe, just play with a dog, just joke with friends. That you also has value.

In the last days of June, you began seeing some progress. Running training improving bit by bit, code optimization getting better bit by bit, understanding of technology deepening bit by bit. Where did this progress come from? Not from anxiety, but from focus.

When you shifted attention from abstract anxiety to concrete things, from worrying about the future to focusing on the present, things started getting better.

Let me ask you a question: if you gave yourself real rest—not the kind where you rest while anxious, while worrying about becoming worthless, but truly allowing yourself to stop, to feel, to experience, to invest wholeheartedly in the present like walking that 40km—what would happen?

Would you discover that what you thought you'd lost—happiness, being moved, creativity—never actually left, they're just waiting for you to give yourself space to let them resurface?

On June 29th you wrote: even crying tears, even crying thoroughly, I'm still willing to believe in beautiful things.

This sentence is so precious. After experiencing so much pain and doubt, you're still willing to believe in beauty. What does this mean? It means that core you, that essential you, has never been destroyed.

You're just too tired. Tired enough to need rest, to need to stop, to need to find again that self who laughs playing with Rosie, relaxes joking with roommates, can feel thick happiness walking 40km.

Near the end of June, you wrote: seeing progress in all areas, feels really good. Isn't this feeling the answer?

You don't need to solve all problems at once, don't need to immediately find life's meaning, don't need to decide right away whether to work or chase dreams. You just need to see that right now, you're progressing. Right now, you're still alive. Right now, you can still feel that really good feeling.

That's enough.

Leave the rest to time. Just like how it took 10 years of training to lift 150kg, 5 years of learning to become an Apache Committer. Some answers need time to reveal themselves. And in this process, what you can do is optimize your life like optimizing code, line by line; walk forward like training for running, step by step; like walking that 40km, in each step, feel that creativity and happiness dwelling deep within.

They've always been there. Just waiting for you to slow down and see them.
