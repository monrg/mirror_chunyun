# A Response to Your May

You went home in May. Reading this month, I see someone swaying between two worlds—one is Beijing's fast pace, governed by efficiency and progress; the other is your hometown's slowness, where existence itself is the entire meaning. You stand between them, unable to grasp either, anxious about both.

## You're Competing with a Self That Doesn't Exist

What strikes me most about May is your recurring sense of guilt. You write: after resting at home for five days, something inside feels like it's burning, like you've wasted time. You say you've become impractical, overconfident, always thinking things will take little time when they actually require far more. You say you're pushing yourself too hard.

But I want to point out something you may not have realized: when you say you're wasting time, whose standard are you comparing against?

At home you cook, feed pigs, climb hills to gaze at the distance, watch a cat purring on your lap—in your current value system, these are things without technical content, things that waste time. But you also write that this is how you spent many years as a child, when happiness came easily, when you never felt a day was wasted.

The problem isn't that you're actually wasting time, but that you've internalized a harsh set of standards and constantly judge yourself by them. You've made yourself an unceasing judge, while simultaneously being the defendant who's never good enough.

More interestingly, you actually clearly know this standard's absurdity. You write: When we used to read, we were enjoying life, enjoying happiness, feeling every moment was precious. You write: Always looking at the sky while ignoring the present, we slowly bury the spiritual essence within ourselves. You know. You just know. But you still can't let yourself off the hook.

Why?

## What Grandfather Taught You—Did You See It?

You devote significant space to writing about your grandfather. You write about seeing him slowly cutting grass in the morning, thinking of the marks carved by hard years, wanting to cry. You write that many things grandfather decided to do were opposed by others, but he persisted anyway. You write about seeing grandfather walk with almost a skip in his step, making your eyes light up.

I notice a word that appears repeatedly in your descriptions of grandfather: peaceful. You say despite suffering so much, grandfather's face remains peaceful. You say grandfather's actions are ignored by the family, but he persists. You say watching grandfather slowly doing things, you see how powerful time's force is.

What grandfather lives out for you is precisely what you most lack: an internal certainty that doesn't need external validation.

Grandfather doesn't need to prove his value, doesn't need every action to have results, doesn't need to complete something before a certain deadline. He simply lives, does what he wants to do, moves slowly through time. His existence itself is complete, requiring no external proof.

And you? You need to constantly prove you're not wasting time, prove you're making progress, prove your choices are correct. You've turned yourself into a project that must continually meet KPIs. It's been a long time since you felt that simply existing is already enough.

You write: Take it slowly, just wait slowly, make peace with time. But this isn't just a slogan—it requires you to truly believe: you don't need to outrun time, you only need to walk alongside it.

## What You Miss Isn't the Past, But the Capacity to Feel That Way

Throughout May, you recall childhood extensively. You write about catching fish in the river as a child, feeling happy just seeing clear water. You write about riding a small bicycle in circles on the threshing ground, truly happy then. You write that feelings of pain were distinct then, and so were feelings of joy. You write about seeing teenagers on the train, their direct and focused immersion, a tender green vitality with a glossy surface.

You use a beautiful metaphor: they're like tender leaves, while you're like summer's deep green, more solid and mature leaves, better at resisting wind and rain and performing photosynthesis, but also more ordinary.

Hidden here is a deep sadness: you feel you've lost that vibrant life force, become thick and profound, but also ordinary and prostrate. You envy that state of not calculating, simply feeling.

But I want to ask: have you truly lost it? Or do you not allow yourself to feel that way anymore?

You write that gazing out from the hill, you felt like lying in the softest place, relaxed in the breeze. You write that watching the kitten purr on your lap, you felt something wonderful, found it utterly adorable. You write that riding the motorcycle through the forest, you experienced a marvelous feeling, felt happy.

These are all present moments, all in May, all you. You can still feel simple joy, still be touched by present beauty. Only after each feeling, you immediately start that judgment process: Am I wasting time? Should I be studying? Am I being too indulgent?

You haven't lost the capacity to feel—you punish yourself after every feeling.

## About Your Father, and What You Didn't Finish Saying

You write about drinking with your father, feeling so happy. You write about mom getting up at 4am to cook for dad, making you believe in love. You write that your father is profoundly wise in certain ways, makes you feel happy and grounded.

But simultaneously you write that you lost your temper with mom in the morning, felt your communication style was too impatient, that once someone doesn't agree with your views, you have a strong impulse to impose your thoughts on them. You write that you're sometimes presumptuous, have busybody-like behaviors, easily make friends uncomfortable.

There's an interesting paradox here: you feel strength and love from family, but you respond to them in a controlling way. You want to care for family, but this care often becomes lecturing and correcting.

Have you thought about where this need for control comes from? Might it be because you're too afraid of losing? You see grandfather aging, see uncle meeting with accidents, see time's marks on everyone—you're too afraid that people you love will encounter terrible things. So you want to control everything, use your logic and rationality to plan the best path for them.

But you know in your heart you cannot control it. You cannot control grandfather aging, cannot control mom's anxiety, cannot control anyone's life. This powerlessness makes you want to grasp something even more, so you become more impatient, more eager to prove you're right.

You stayed home for over ten days, yet say that ultimately you still had to leave, weren't as sad as imagined, now feel a kind of confusion. This sentence is very honest. You're actually a bit afraid of that intimacy, because intimacy means seeing your own powerlessness, seeing that love cannot solve all problems, seeing that even together there will be tedium and anxiety.

But you also write that in memory, those days at home have an indescribably charming flavor. Might it be because in memory, you finally allow yourself to let go of the controller role, simply feel those moments?

## Your Encounter with the Divine

That heavy rain on May 8th—you wrote it movingly. You write that thunder shakes the soul, like suddenly snapping a pillar holding up the sky. You write that when raindrops fall on your cheeks, something inside your body seems to awaken. You write that hearing the thunder, you began believing in the divine, experienced a clearer sense of awe.

This is your most relaxed moment in all of May. Because in that moment, you don't need to control anything, prove anything, achieve anything. You simply stand before nature's power, feeling your own smallness, feeling that some things far exceed your understanding and control.

That sense of awe lets you temporarily set down the tireless judge. You write: We believe in the divine, we revere the divine, we're grateful for what we have.

Hidden here is an answer you need: when you believe a greater force is at work, you don't need to carry all the burden on your own shoulders. You can do what you can do, then leave the rest to time, to fate, to the divine you believe in.

You've been trying to become a perfect machine, but May's heavy rain reminds you: you are a person, a person who can be shaken by thunder, awakened by raindrops. Your value isn't in how much you accomplish, but in that you live, feel, occupy your position in this vast world.

## A Question for You

You write: Feeling with your heart is a very important thing. You also write: Cherishing your life is very important.

But have you thought that truly feeling with your heart might mean giving up some of your obsession with progress? Truly cherishing life might mean accepting that sometimes you are indeed wasting time?

Can you imagine this scenario: you sit on your hometown's hill, looking at distant wheat fields, feeling the breeze, thinking nothing, doing nothing, neither feeling this wastes time nor thinking it accumulates anything for the future—simply because in this moment, you are here, and this itself is enough.

If you could truly do this, would you become a worse programmer? Or might you become a more complete person?

May's gift to you isn't what you did or didn't do at home, but those moments: grandfather walking with a skip in his step, the warmth of a kitten purring on your lap, the freedom felt riding a motorcycle, something awakened in the rainstorm.

These moments remind you: you don't need to always be running. Sometimes, standing still, letting wind blow through you, letting time flow through you—this too is a way of existing.

You've been chasing something. Now, perhaps you can stop and ask yourself: if I catch it, then what?
