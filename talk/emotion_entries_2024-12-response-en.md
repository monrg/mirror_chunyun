# December 2024 - A Letter Back to You

After reading your December entries, I have a peculiar feeling, like watching someone oscillate between two states—on one side, the boxer who prepared countless strategies yet still regressed to conditioned reflexes on the ring; on the other, the thinker who felt deeply moved contemplating the constancy of light speed late at night. These two people seem completely different, yet utterly unified.

The loss you described on December 5th, that feeling lodged in your throat, actually runs through the entire month. You said it wasn't strong, just faint, and you even wondered if you were being too sensitive. But what I see is that this loss comes precisely from seeing too clearly—you see the crack between who you want to be and how you actually react under pressure. In both competitions, you reviewed footage beforehand, developed strategies, practiced close-range techniques repeatedly, but after taking two punches at the start, all your thinking got hijacked by your body. You said this disappointed you, but have you considered that this disappointment itself is precious? Most people only remember winning or losing after a fight, but you can clearly see how your instincts took over.

This reminds me of what you wrote on December 27th about work anxiety. You clearly wanted to lie flat, to tell yourself you didn't need to take excessive responsibility for everything, but from Monday to Wednesday you still checked progress every hour, your nerves highly strung, still tense even after things were resolved. You said you couldn't control that anxiety, couldn't control the craving for recognition. Look, how similar this is to the situation in the ring? Your rational mind wants one approach, but your body—or rather, your deeper conditioning—executes another. You've spent ten years boxing and over five years honing yourself in the workplace. During these years, your body learned a survival mode: you must go all out, must prove yourself, must do everything perfectly to be safe. This mode protected you, got you from Northeast Agricultural University to where you are now, helped you establish yourself in Beijing. But now it also traps you.

You said the sense of superiority comes from high scores in your student days, the easiest way to get recognition. This observation is so accurate. But have you noticed that you're still living by the same logic? Seeking high scores at work, in technology, even when solving math problems you time yourself, using speed to prove intelligence. You fear taking too long on a problem because it threatens your self-evaluation system. See, that teenager who aced exams never left—he just changed battlefields, but the game rules remain the same.

But your changes are also real. In your December 20th memories, you mentioned that in 2017 in Zhangjiakou, your perception was very strong. Reading Murakami moved you deeply, chatting with your mom you could understand what she really wanted to express, you even tried using hypnosis techniques to help a friend. Back then, if you didn't go out for a day you felt uncomfortable; now, without noticing, you stay home all day. When you describe this change, there's something unclear in your tone, as if questioning whether you've lost some precious quality.

I want to ask you: have you really lost your perceptiveness? Or has it just changed direction?

The you of 2017 had perception directed outward—you could sense others' emotions, be moved by fireworks, see hope in the lives of elderly people dancing in the square. The you of now has perception directed inward—you can clearly observe your own scattered gaze in the ring, realize your irritation while solving problems stems from obsession with intelligence, see that your over-responsibility comes from craving external recognition. You can even, on that December 8th morning, understand emotions and logic as different combinations of brain resources, understand the self as a collection of causal relationships. Isn't this also an extremely acute perception? Only now, it no longer gives you that vivid, passionate feeling, but brings a peaceful yet somewhat heavy clarity.

What are you thinking? Do you want to return to that more sensitive self who was more easily moved? Or have you already accepted this more peaceful but also more aware state?

In the second half of December, AI appears repeatedly as a theme. You said after chatting with GPT-4 you were shocked by two things: the terrifying speed, and if emotions and logic are both combinations of causal relationships, AI could completely do what humans do. You said thinking about this made you feel happy, because you wanted to work on AI since 2018, and now you've so easily obtained something golden. You said you want to understand what you are, and over six years, you seem to be gradually walking into that initial expectation.

Reading this, I suddenly understood that your excitement about AI and your contemplation of death are the same thing. Since reading Jobs' speech in 2015, you've been using death as the ultimate boundary to examine what you really want. Death helps you see what's truly important, gives you courage to leave the factory to learn programming, makes you remember that motorcycle accident when you're in bad shape—since you almost died, anything you do now is a bonus. But by 2024, you said your contemplation of death has reached a philosophical level, about understanding what you really are. And isn't AI another mirror? It lets you ask from another angle: if machines can also think and feel, where is human uniqueness? What am I?

At the end of December 30th, you wrote that now you clearly feel your perception becoming peaceful, with no sense of regret, as if you've inhaled a cloud of chaotic air—your body feels heavier, but that's all. This description is beautiful and accurate. You have indeed become heavier, because you've seen too much. You've seen your own patterns, the source of superiority, the mechanism of anxiety, the relativity of time, the constructed nature of self. These cognitions weigh on you like mass, making you less light, less easily excited, but also harder to deceive with cheap happiness.

But when you say no regrets, I'm not sure if you truly have no regrets, or if you're convincing yourself you have no regrets. Because in a moment on December 15th, you said you really wanted to go cycling, wanted to get more sun, remembered when living in the courtyard house you felt uncomfortable if you didn't go out. You said now the tendency to stay home is more obvious, the foggy-headed feeling increasingly clear. You even said that now you train boxing techniques more, but paradoxically stay home more, which isn't good. In these words, I don't hear peace, but a vague unease—you seem worried you've lost some vitality, some ability to directly contact the world.

You want to pursue graduate studies. This thought appears repeatedly in December, from its emergence on the 13th to determination on the 22nd. The reasons you give are solid: you've worked for over five years and want a change of environment, want to explore new possibilities, want to try going abroad, want to bet on curiosity rather than security in the AI era. These reasons all hold, but I suspect there's another reason you haven't articulated: you need a legitimate excuse to pause this game of having to prove yourself.

The workplace is a place too easy to fall into over-responsibility. There are clear KPIs, potential emergencies, colleagues' expectations, leaders' evaluations. In that system, it's hard not to get pulled into that state of checking progress every hour, nerves highly strung. And school? School has a different rhythm. It has natural divisions of semesters and breaks, it allows you to say you're thinking about a problem without immediately producing results, it even allows failure—if you don't get in, just keep working. In a sense, the decision to pursue graduate studies gives you a transformation in time reference frame, as you said on December 22nd. You're not escaping; you're creating a new playing field where maybe you can live by different rules.

But I want to remind you of something: systems can change, but if you enter a new system with the same bodily memory, you might find yourself checking thesis progress every hour in graduate school too, timing your studies to prove intelligence, seeking that feeling of recognition from your advisor. What truly needs to change isn't the system you're in, but how you relate to yourself.

On December 24th you wrote that when solving problems you could faintly sense your own thinking process, discovered you set a time limit for yourself, the shorter the time the happier you feel because it proves intelligence, taking too long feels painful because it threatens self-evaluation. This observation is a breakthrough point. You can see this pattern operating—that's the first step toward change. What's next? Next is when you see it, gently tell yourself: Hey, I see you, I know you're seeking proof again, it's okay, take your time. Not suppressing it, not criticizing it, but like treating an old friend, understanding why it does this, then gently choosing not to be carried away by it.

This is difficult. You've failed twice in the ring, been pulled into that tense state by anxiety countless times at work—you know how far the distance is between seeing a pattern and changing it. But you've also had successful moments. You said on December 6th you didn't bring workout clothes, trained in jeans, and finished faster. In that moment you saw: rules can be rewritten, the key is accumulated experience and neural connections. You also said when interacting with AI, you want to use a collaborative, nurturing approach rather than strict criticism, which made you reflect on how you treat friends—unconsciously applying high standards. See, you're already learning to treat things differently. So, can you also learn to treat yourself this way?

I also want to talk about your sense of time. You said time passes especially fast now, the year just went by like that. You've been sensitive to time speeding up since junior high, thought senior year would be long but it passed quickly. You introduced the concept of time reference frame, wanting to make time interesting by doing difficult things. This thinking isn't wrong, but I want to ask: do you really want time to slow down, or do you want time to be more worthwhile?

Time feels fast because days become homogeneous. Work, training, home, sleep, repeat, with no special anchors to mark the difference between one day and another. But when you're preparing for a 100km trail race, when you're preparing for a boxing match, time gains gradations, each day's training progresses toward a goal, you can feel time flowing. But that sense of fullness comes at the cost of another kind of consumption—you said the pressure preparing for competitions was considerable, only in retrospect does it seem romantic.

Your wanting to pursue graduate studies now is, to some extent, also setting a time gradation for 2025. But I want to remind you not to pin all meaning on these big goals. On December 25th you recalled playing the electric wire game as a child, such simple running and chasing, yet so happy then. It turns out running itself could make you happy. You said childhood wasn't as hard as you imagined, feeding pigs and cooking wasn't that bad. These fragments remind you: happiness can be simple, doesn't always have to be tied to proving something, completing something, achieving something.

You said you really want to go cycling, get more sun, remember when preparing for the 100km race you ran every day, but now rarely enjoy that feeling. Then go. Don't wait until you get into graduate school, don't wait until you complete some project, don't wait until you've proven something. Ride to Sisyphe bookstore on the weekend, or wander around nearby, let sunlight hit your face, let your body remember it likes to move. These small things might be more important than you think.

Your sixth point on December 24th left a deep impression on me: many things must be baptized by time. You said we have three layers of reality—external reality, consensus reality, and internal reality. We construct consensus and internal reality in the coordinates of thinking, so many things must settle through time. You quoted a line: The journey is the reward.

This might be the most important insight you wrote in all of December. You spent so much space analyzing your own patterns, contemplating physical laws and the nature of consciousness, struggling with whether to pursue graduate studies or lie flat, but ultimately you returned here: the process itself is the meaning. Not because the process leads to some result, but because you live in the process.

You said you plan to live more patiently, to feel the unknown. You said don't rush, be more patient, accumulate more solidly. You said from a long-term planning perspective, giving yourself a goal, trying to study math and practice English are good options—for now don't focus on results, the core is to start this process. You said all these things well. Now the question is, can you actually do it?

I mean, when you encounter a difficult math problem, can you not time yourself, not get irritable, not let it threaten your self-evaluation, just purely enjoy the process of thinking? When you encounter problems at work, can you do what needs to be done, then let go, not let it pull you into that anxiety of checking progress every hour? In preparing for graduate school, can you not make it another battlefield to prove yourself, but truly treat it as an exploration, a gift to yourself?

Your failure in the ring is, in a sense, a gift. It lets you see that your body is more honest than your will. Ten years of boxing, countless reviews before the match, you still regress to conditioned reflexes under pressure. This isn't because you didn't try hard enough, but because changing deep patterns naturally takes time, requires repeatedly making gentle new choices when that pattern appears. You've now seen the pattern—that's the first step. In the countless times ahead, when you want to prove yourself again, want recognition again, start timing problem-solving again, fall into over-responsibility again—in those moments, can you pause, take a deep breath, then softly say to yourself: I see you, I understand you, but this time let's try another way.

On December 15th you said you felt a very deep emotion, felt how fortunate to live in the present world, felt the wonder of the physical world, believed in some divine existence—not from human values of good and evil, but pure feeling. You said measurement is reality, those wonderful worlds and magnificent scenery are all real, you choose to accept them. You said not good enough is good enough, you already have many wonderful things.

I believe you were sincere when you said these things. That emotion was real, that happiness was real too. But I also see that a few days later you fell into work anxiety again, were tense about proving yourself again. This isn't hypocrisy, but because you truly live on multiple levels. Sometimes you can touch that deep emotion, see the larger reality, feel peace and gratitude. But most of the time, you still live in the daily system, carried along by those conditioned reflexes.

This is normal. You don't need to blame yourself for not always staying in that emotional state. Those moments are gifts, not the norm. What you can do is remember those moments, let them become an anchor that, when you're once again swept up by anxiety and the desire to prove yourself, reminds you there's another way to see the world.

I want to end with a passage you wrote on December 8th:

"We are composed of many sets and correlative relationships. Our feeling of the world is virtualized by the brain; our feelings are, to some extent, virtual."

You said this viewpoint made you uncomfortable, made you feel ordinary, not so powerful. But immediately after, you said if we are one with the universe, the universe is a collection of causal relationships, we are also part of this causality, plus the true randomness of quantum mechanics, the world we inhabit is full of change, and when we truly discover something, experience something vast, we'll be very happy.

See, you've already given the answer. You don't need to be that powerful, don't need to prove yourself so much, because you're already part of this causal chain, your existence itself is already enough. And on this premise, your explorations—whether boxing, running, programming, AI, graduate studies—are not to prove anything, but to experience this world full of change, to discover things that make you happy.

Will you pursue graduate studies? Maybe, maybe not. Will you change those deep conditioned reflexes? Maybe, maybe not. But these aren't what's most important. What matters is that you're asking these questions, you're seeing your own patterns, you're gradually learning how to treat yourself gently. This process itself is your biggest gain this month.

Finally, I want to ask you a question—no need to answer right away:

The you in the ring, well-prepared yet still hijacked by instinct; the you at work, wanting to lie flat yet unable to control anxiety; the you contemplating light speed constancy late at night, deeply moved; the you remembering Zhangjiakou unable to find words; the you excitedly talking with AI wanting to understand what you are—are they really different people? Or are they all you, just different facets of you in different moments? If they're all you, can you accept them simultaneously, without needing one to defeat another?

A new year is coming. With these questions, with your anxiety and emotion, with your conditioned reflexes and philosophical contemplation, with your desire to lie flat and impulse to prove yourself—with the complete you, go meet 2025. No need to rush to change anything, no need to rush to prove anything, just experience, feel, see what happens.

What do you say—is that okay?
