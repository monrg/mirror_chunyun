# Response to Your February

In your February writings, there's a sadness that almost spills over. You repeatedly say you want to cry, want to sob, but can't, as if you've swallowed a stone that's stuck in your chest, choking you. Reading this, I can feel that suffocation—not because something catastrophic happened in your life, but because you've finally realized that in this world you thought you could calculate with logic and control with reason, some things simply can't be computed.

You say you spent 10 days at home, time flew by, disappeared as if you'd done nothing. Then the next morning, a wave of intense sadness hit you. You felt so small, unsure why you're alive. Suddenly, you missed Hong Li terribly, her voice surfacing in your mind, that comfortable gentleness. You wrote: Only in gradually distancing myself did I begin to understand that those seemingly natural moments together were actually both parties making effort.

This sentence pierced me. Because it means that while you were with her, you didn't recognize her efforts, didn't fully appreciate how precious those naturally flowing moments were. You were busy calculating whether conditions matched, judging whether it was worthwhile, so much so that only after losing it did you discover that what you'd always had was exactly what you needed most—someone to talk with until past 1 AM, a voice that made you feel gentle, an interesting soul.

You say loneliness has this flavor, somewhat bitter. But have you considered that this bitterness doesn't come from loneliness itself, but from the taste you experience after personally pushing away the person who could ease that loneliness? In your January diary, you wrote about calculating during your time with Hong Li, feeling the material disparity was too great, feeling unwilling to settle. By February, you're so lonely you want to cry, wanting to erase yourself completely from anyone's memory, to lie down utterly, no work, no responsibilities, no expectations to bear.

Do you see the connection here? You crave freedom from expectations and responsibilities, yet you're using various standards to expect things from others, demanding relationships reach some level you've calculated. You want lightness, but you've placed a heavy system of judgment on both yourself and others. You say there's a hole in your heart, a missing piece, everything feels slightly wrong. I think that hole didn't appear because Hong Li left—it was always there. It's just that when she was with you, those nights talking until 1 AM, those seemingly natural moments together, temporarily filled it. And when you used reason to push her away, that hole revealed itself again.

You mention that your Beijing apartment is much more comfortable than home, you sleep well, can wash comfortably, but somehow your heart feels sad, wanting to cry but unable to. This passage reminds me of that night by the fire you wrote about in January. You said the environment was crude then, but you felt happy. Now the environment is comfortable, yet you're sad. You summarize it as: not good enough is good enough. But I think the real feeling is: materially good enough doesn't equal emotionally good enough. You've substituted material improvement for emotional needs, then wonder why you still feel empty.

You write about Ge Wen getting married, chatting with Yu Sheng who seems more confident. You say from the outside you look fortunate—5 years of material accumulation, no debt, even being laid off wouldn't be a problem. But there's this gray film over your brain, desperately wanting to cry but no tears come, like a swallowed stone choking you. Do you know why? Because you've finally discovered that all those things you've been chasing—salary growth, technical improvement, material accumulation—they did come, but they didn't fill that hole in your heart. That hole needs connection, gentleness, companionship that doesn't require calculation.

Later you begin meditating, learning JVM, your focus satisfies you, progress exceeds expectations. Yet you're confused: what's the point of studying technology like this? Finishing Scala, DDIA, JVM—feeling urgent while studying, remembering nothing afterward, what's the meaning of doing this? This confusion is essentially the same as your confusion about Hong Li—you keep investing, but always questioning meaning, always judging the present process by future results. You can't simply enjoy learning itself, enjoy being together itself—you always need to give them an explanation, a reason to prove they're worthwhile.

You quote Murakami, saying he only paid off his loan at 33, still had to do physical labor, you feel fortunate, should be more patient. But are you really patient? You're unsatisfied with technical progress, unsatisfied with athletic performance, unsatisfied with relationship development. You say pursuing excellence and seeing reality aren't contradictory, they're interdependent. But let me ask: have you really seen reality? Reality is, someone who can talk with you until 1 AM is already rare; reality is, being able to focus on learning, having a healthy body, stable work is already good; reality is, not everything needs proven meaning—some things are meaning itself.

You wrote Hong Li a long letter, saying you want to understand her, know what she's passionate about, what makes her feel lost and helpless, wanting to become a library recording her joys, sorrows, wisdom, and loveliness. These words are beautiful. But I can't help wondering: when you were with her, were you actually doing these things? Or were you calculating material conditions, judging compatibility, weighing worthiness? After losing her, you finally want to do what you should have done while you had her.

Finally you say, grateful for this experience, gained much, resumed meditation, began experiencing life anew. You say you sincerely wish her happiness. I believe that's true. But I want to ask you more: are you ready to let yourself be happy? Not that material abundance, technical progress kind of happy, but that talking-until-1-AM, wrapped-in-gentleness, no-calculating-or-weighing kind of happy. That hole has always been there. It won't be filled by doubled salary or improved skills. It can only be filled by real connection, genuine investment, being-together-without-asking-if-it's-worth-it.

Are you ready?
