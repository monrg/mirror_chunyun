# To You in June 2019

After reading this running journal, what struck me first wasn't that you completed 21 kilometers, but rather that opening line—you wanted to think about things while running. Yet by the end, you never told me what you thought about. Perhaps that's the most honest answer: you set out to solve something with your mind, but your body responded in its own way.

What you discovered that morning wasn't really a running route, but a world that had always been there, waiting for you to notice it. The breakfast vendors, the people hurrying to work, the families playing by the river, the runners already on the forest path at 6:30 AM—they were always there, living at their own rhythms. You were surprised to find that so many people were up even earlier than you. What's hidden in that surprise? Had you been feeling, all this time, that you were alone, different, perhaps a bit out of step with the world?

That line, we're all the same kind of people, said so lightly yet weighing so much. You finally felt, in that moment, through your own exhaustion and the presence of strangers around you, a sense of belonging. Not because you knew each other, not because you spoke, but simply because you were all there in the same morning, treating your bodies and time with the same honesty. Isn't this connection closer to the answer than whatever question you had planned to think about?

I also noticed a detail: blood blisters formed on your feet, but you said you'd gone numb so you didn't know. Isn't this a metaphor? Sometimes we must go numb to keep going; sometimes we choose not to feel the pain because feeling it would mean having to stop. From kilometer 14 onward, you kept wanting to give up, but the desire to reach your goal was stronger—this isn't just about running, is it? How many things in life are like this: wanting to quit while continuing to move forward, crawling along as you put it, almost creeping.

You used the word desolate to describe the feeling when your legs lost coordination. Such a precise choice. Not painful, not difficult, but desolate—a clear-eyed recognition of reaching your limits, a revelation of the complex relationship between a person and their own body. But right after, when you finished the 21 kilometers, you said: difficult, but also happy. Notice: not difficult but worth it, not difficult but successful, but rather difficulty and happiness existing simultaneously, neither canceling the other out.

This makes me want to ask you: after that run, did that rich world remain? Could you still see those early risers, still hear that solo music? Or did you return to a state where you needed extreme physical exertion to feel alive?

I'm also curious about those various concerns you had the night before. Were you worried you couldn't do it? Afraid of bothering someone? Uncertain whether you deserved such a morning? And when you actually set out, where did those concerns go? Were they proven unnecessary, or did you simply step past them, one footfall at a time?

Finally, have you noticed that you're constantly oscillating between escape and seeking? You wanted to do something, so you went running; you wanted to think, but got filled with sensory experience instead; you found the world vast, and yourself small; you wanted to quit, yet kept moving forward. Could this coexistence of contradictions be your actual state of living?

That version of you who got up just after 5 AM, who crept along the riverbank, who stopped by a flower bed to post on social media—you've already told yourself so much. Perhaps you just haven't had time to listen yet.
