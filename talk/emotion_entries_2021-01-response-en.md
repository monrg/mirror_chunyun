# To You in January 2021

After reading your words from this month, an image came to mind: someone standing in a hallway between two doors—one leading to memory, the other to an unknown tomorrow—and there you are, caught in the middle, belonging to neither side, drawn to both. Your knee injury wasn't just a simple accident. It was more like life forcibly hitting the pause button, making you stop and see things you couldn't notice while rushing forward.

You mentioned that after reading One Hundred Years of Solitude, you couldn't tell whether you were in reality or in Macondo. This line made me pause. You know what? This sense of disorientation isn't because of García Márquez's magical realism—it's because your own memories have started taking on magical qualities. Those apricots from Huihui's yard, the sweet taste of alfalfa, walking between classroom desks on crutches in fourth grade—why do these feel less and less real in your mind? Not because they're too distant in time, but because your current way of living is completely different from back then. You said that as a child you were parched with desire for unripe apricots and goldfish, but now you feel like an empty shell. The issue isn't that you've lost your capacity for desire—it's that what you desire now—skills, recognition, meaning, extraordinariness—these things are no longer concrete, no longer something you can put in your mouth and chew.

You mentioned repeatedly the pain of learning and forgetting. You saw ClickHouse and retained something, but looking back you feel like nothing remained—same with operating systems and design patterns. I can imagine this feeling, just as you described: reaching for the cat, your fingertips already touching its soft fur, and the next second it jumps away. But have you considered this: during that year in childhood when you practiced arithmetic, do you remember any specific problems now? Certainly not. But was that year wasted? Of course not—because back then you weren't learning to memorize specific knowledge points; you were training a way of thinking, building a relationship with numbers and logic. Your learning has become anxious now because you treat it as possession—you want to store knowledge in your brain, preserve it permanently, access it anytime. But learning was never like that. It's more like your body continuously rubbing against the world, leaving some traces, changing some muscle memory. The specific details were always meant to fade.

When handling IP matching, ideas immediately surfaced. You said this came from studying ClickHouse. See? This is what real learning looks like—not how many knowledge points you've memorized, but when facing a problem, certain approaches naturally emerge. You said that past efforts didn't vanish into nothing, they've always been there, and peace and calm rose in your heart. I especially love this moment, because this is what's true. Those other anxieties about having learned nothing are, to a large extent, an illusion.

You said you're starting to lose some sensitivity, that passion for life is quietly slipping away. I want to tell you: you haven't lost sensitivity. On the contrary, you might be more sensitive now than before—sensitive enough to notice subtle shifts in your emotions, to clearly recall at 2 AM the taste of apricots in fourth grade, to feel lightness from watching your cat scratch the scratching post. What you've lost isn't sensitivity, but a kind of unreflective immersion. As a child, eating an apricot was just eating an apricot, playing soccer was just playing soccer—you didn't wonder about meaning, didn't question if you were wasting time. Now you calculate the cost of everything, always asking is this worth it, and this calculation itself scatters your passion. You said you suddenly remembered why you loved playing soccer so much—that sense of achievement, the thrill of defeating opponents felt so pure. Pure precisely because there was no why.

About being ordinary—this might be the most important word from this month. You said you never used to find the prospect of becoming ordinary so anxiety-inducing; you just lived each day as it came. When did this change? You mentioned that year in Zhangjiakou, experiencing courage and romance through Saint-Exupéry's words, being moved and gaining strength, while also being tormented. I suspect that's when it started—when you installed an expectation that your life should be extraordinary, and that expectation became a ruler, constantly measuring your daily life, making ordinary days seem inadequate. You saw your friend Bin with his family and child, and your heart sank, feeling you have nothing. But what are you really jealous of? His family, or the fact that he appears to be walking a defined path while you're still searching?

You said that life, to some degree, is extremely ordinary, and during good times it's easy to forget what you've gained. This is such a good observation. You're in a paradoxical state right now: on one hand feeling your daily life is too ordinary, on the other hand nostalgic for those ordinary moments of the past—playing soccer, eating apricots, doing arithmetic. What does this tell us? That ordinariness itself isn't the problem. The problem is whether you're fully present in that ordinariness. Eating apricots as a child was ordinary, but you were entirely in that desire and satisfaction, so it became a magical memory. Now you do things every day too, but your heart isn't here—it's comparing with the past, anxious about the future, calculating returns on investment, so these days just flow away, leaving nothing, not even clear memories.

You mentioned The Myth of Sisyphus, how we simultaneously desire and fear tomorrow—a contradictory psychology. I think this contradiction is particularly pronounced in you. You want to create an amazing product, crave recognition, want to see what power lies dormant inside you, but at the same time you're afraid that after going all in you'll discover you're just... this. So you fill time with learning, counter anxiety with planning, comfort the present with memories—but that thing you most want to do, creating something great, have you actually started? Or are you perpetually preparing for it?

You said you want to fall in love, that you feel lonely at times, yearning for an imagined romance. But you also said, looking at friends' lives, where is that ideal state? Dissatisfaction is perhaps part of life. These words sound mature, but I want to ask: what are you waiting for? Are you waiting for an ideal state before beginning, or accepting that dissatisfaction is part of life and then beginning? You said human connection is largely constructed from memory and behavior—this is so true. But how do memories and behaviors come about? Only through actual time together, through specific, ordinary, even somewhat boring daily moments that slowly accumulate.

Your knee was injured for eight months. You said you truly experienced the fragility and smallness of the flesh as a container. In a way, this injury was a gift, though painful, though it disrupted your plans. It made you stop, made you see time, see memory, see your real self. You said the more you think about these things, the more curious you become about intelligence, wanting to participate in the evolution of AI. But then you immediately said that maybe all this is just imagination, most things won't change, we'll finish each day in the ordinary and tedious just like now. See? You're doing the same thing again: first giving yourself a grand vision, then immediately using maybe it's just imagination to protect yourself from the disappointment of actually committing.

I want to ask you a few questions—no need to answer immediately, just let them sit in your heart:

You said you must maintain curiosity and passion, but what if curiosity and passion aren't meant to be maintained, but to be spent? Where would you spend them?

You mentioned values, rules, beliefs—that what we pursue is change and the virtual, so why not try living with indifference? If you truly didn't care, what's the first thing you'd want to do tomorrow?

You said you've somewhat mystified your self-positioning, which is not good. What would a non-mystified version of yourself look like?

In your memories you see a vital version of yourself, living quite coolly. Without looking at memories, just looking at today—was there any moment today, even a tiny one, that you thought was pretty cool?

About forgetting what you've learned, about time passing, about becoming ordinary—I want to say these are all real, but they're not problems. They're the texture of life itself. You don't need to become extraordinary. What you need is to find that thing which lets you temporarily forget the question of ordinary versus extraordinary, something you can throw yourself into completely—like doing arithmetic problems as a child, like completing a perfect move in soccer, like the excitement when battling with friends. You said you urgently want to do some things well, that the process might bring torture, pain, and guilt, that the result might still be disappointment with nothing gained, but you still want to try. This sentence contains the answer. You already know what to do—you're just waiting for the right moment, or waiting until you're better prepared. But the moment will never be right, preparation will never be enough. Life begins in a not-good-enough state and gets shaped in the process.

Why are your memories flooding in like a tide at this particular time? I think it's because your body and soul are both reminding you that you need to rediscover that self who made direct contact with the world—not through meaning, not through value, not through comparison, but just directly being alive. These memories aren't meant to take you back. They're here to tell you that you once had that ability, and you still do now—you've just buried it under too much thinking and calculating.

January 2021: you were injured, you stopped, you thought a lot, and you saw a lot. This month wasn't a month of loss—it was a turning point. You've been standing in that hallway for quite a while now. Perhaps it's time to choose a door and walk through.
