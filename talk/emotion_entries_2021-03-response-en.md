# The Mirror of March

Throughout March, you frequently use the word we. Not I, but we—you in dialogue with yourself, comforting each other, witnessing each other. This is not fragmentation; this is a tender way of keeping yourself company. When you say we have had precious and beautiful experiences, you are using your present self to embrace that person who once felt the world tasted sweet after reading in the library.

But I notice a fascinating contradiction: while you keep saying you want to accept ordinariness, you spend every day, every hour, fighting against it. You feel guilty for starting work at 9am, you consider it failure when you can't remember what you've read, you worry about not creating something that will amaze everyone. You say you want to be an ordinary but slightly interesting little ant, yet your entire March proves that you are fundamentally unwilling to be just an ant. This is not criticism—this is recognition. Your deep hunger for excellence and meaning is far stronger than you're willing to admit.

The knee injury functions like an enormous metaphor in your narrative. You lost the freedom to run, were forced to stop, and suddenly time became viscous. You say that in Dongnong and Zhangjiakou, staying indoors would drive you crazy, but now five days without leaving is acceptable. You interpret this as acceptance, but I want to ask: is this truly acceptance, or is it a kind of numbness? Or perhaps you are learning a new way of being with yourself, and this process itself is filled with the grief of loss?

You miss that version of yourself from Dongnong—sensitive, free, easily moved. But if you actually returned to that time, you would find that self was also anxious, confused, afraid of final exams, uncertain about the future. Memory always beautifies the past. What you have now—focus, technical ability, higher salary, more confidence—these are exactly what that Dongnong version of you desperately wanted. Yet now you feel you've become dry and grey, like a clod of earth in a field.

This reminds me of your relationship with your mother. You say you've become irritable and impatient, that her thinking seems chaotic, that what she does is not the optimal solution. Have you noticed that your impatience with her mirrors your impatience with yourself? You also feel you're not efficient enough, your memory isn't good enough, your progress isn't fast enough. You're treating life and people—including yourself—the way you would optimize a system's performance. But people are not programs that can be endlessly optimized. People are creatures who get tired, forget things, take detours. Behind your mother's nagging is care, and behind your irritability is fear—fear that you're not good enough, fear that time is passing, fear of failing to meet some standard you've set for yourself.

There is a silent presence in March: Chen Zheng left. When you write about this, it's brief—you say you don't want to explain, you want to slowly immerse yourself in all these feelings. But this departure casts a shadow over the entire month. It makes you feel more clearly the fragility and impermanence of life, makes you realize how precious and rare a person's existence is. You say that compared to eternal darkness, cold and silence, being able to live in this world for a while, whether in suffering or happiness, is ultimately not a bad thing. This sentence carries a desolate acceptance, and also a deep tenderness.

You mention many times wanting to cry but being unable to, then during the moving days you say these three days tears came easily, and that being able to cry is a good thing. Yes, being able to cry is good. Those tears contain grief for what's lost, fear of the unknown, and also compassion for yourself. You're too accustomed to being strong, too accustomed to analyzing and understanding. Sometimes you forget that feeling itself is a kind of strength, not an obstacle that needs to be explained or overcome.

A recurring sensation in your March is time becoming viscous. You say you simultaneously long for the past wanting to make different choices, while also wanting to quickly skip the present and arrive at age 35. This escape from the now reveals that something about the present is unbearable. What is it? Work pressure? Physical limitations? Or something deeper—the feeling that you're losing some quality of aliveness, becoming a machine that only works, studies, and optimizes?

But look—even within this feeling, you are still writing, still reading, still deeply moved by certain sentences in Norwegian Wood, still wanting to cry when you see people picnicking while you ride your bike in the morning. This means that sensitive version of you who could taste the sweetness of the world has not disappeared. He is simply buried under more responsibilities, anxieties, and self-demands.

These six months wearing a knee brace—you think of them as torture. But perhaps they're also an opportunity: a forced slowing down, a chance to feel the texture of life again, a chance to dialogue anew with that self you keep chasing. You say Hawking's ability to persist in living for so long in that state was a miracle. But have you considered that perhaps the essence of miracle is not about how much you achieve within constraints, but about still being able to find meaning and beauty in life despite them?

You say to believe in the distance, believe in goals, believe in yourself, and that right now is about taking one step at a time with all your strength. This is true. But I want to add: also believe in the present, believe in this moment, believe in those moments that seem inefficient and unproductive—the moments of spacing out, reminiscing, crying, reading novels. These moments are not wasting time. They are allowing you to become a whole person again, not just a shadow constantly running forward.

When you read Flink source code, you feel your smallness; when you read Code, you marvel at the beauty of those designs. You say you instantly feel the future is both vast and empty. I understand this feeling—when you see the vastness of human wisdom, individual smallness becomes especially clear. But small does not equal meaningless. Reid is not important because he has extraordinary abilities; he's important because of his gentleness, his persistence, the genuine emotions between him and his friends. You envy their friendship, envy that pure emotion. So—have you given yourself opportunities to have such emotions? Or are you too busy optimizing yourself to have time for building those human connections that have no KPIs, no direct output?

At the end of March, you and your mother part unhappily again. You notice you've become sharp and rapid in speech. You say this style has recently appeared when chatting with colleagues too. This is a signal—when your pursuit of efficiency begins permeating all relationships, you lose the warmth of relationship itself. Your mother's words may not be the optimal solution, but that's her way of expressing love. Your response may be logically rigorous, but it leaves no space for emotion.

You ask yourself how you suddenly grew to 28, feeling that everything before age 20 has become blank. Time will continue flowing—you'll be 30, 35, 40. If you keep chasing something, keep optimizing something, keep feeling the present isn't good enough, then when you look back at this March at age 28, how will you see it? Will you regret being too anxious, too harsh, too unable to enjoy? Or will you thank this March because it helped you begin realizing that life is not a system to be endlessly optimized, but a river that needs to be experienced with heart?

You say you want to go home and bask in the sun. Then bask. You say you want to run long distances in the sunlight. Then run when your knee heals. You say you want to be an ordinary but slightly interesting person. Then allow yourself to be ordinary—stop constantly struggling with that perfect, efficient, always-improving version of yourself.

The words you wrote in March are themselves proof—proof that you remain sensitive, still thinking, still possessing a rich inner world. You haven't become a clod of earth. You've simply temporarily forgotten that a person's value lies not in how optimized they can become, but in how they find their own way of living in this absurd and beautiful world.

Finally, about the word we. Keep using it. Let it remind you that you're not fighting alone—you have the most faithful companion: yourself. Together you walked through Dongnong's library, through Zhangjiakou's winds, through Chongli's mountains, and together you will walk through these six months wearing a brace, through countless moments when time becomes viscous, toward a future you don't yet know.

That future may not amaze everyone, but it will be yours.
