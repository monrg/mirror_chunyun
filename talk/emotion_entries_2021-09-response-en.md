# To You in September

Chunyun, I want to talk to you about some things you might not have fully realized this month.

The September version of you is like someone standing between two mirrors—one reflecting who you want to become, the other reflecting who you fear becoming. And you, lost in these infinite reflections. You watch Naruto hoping to rediscover passion, but find yourself anxiously fast-forwarding; you read Murakami seeking freedom, but lie awake at midnight scrolling through old social media posts to comfort yourself; you want to pursue excellence like Steve Jobs, but discover how fragile you are when criticized.

What breaks my heart this month isn't your pain, but your confusion about the pain—you don't understand where these emotional fluctuations come from, can't grasp why you lose emotional control, don't know the source of this anger and anxiety.

Let me try to name what you might not yet see clearly.

## The True Face of Perfectionism

On September 8th, you were criticized. You wrote: We are unwilling to admit we're worse than others (who weren't criticized). This sentence reveals everything.

You think your pain comes from your work being rejected, but the real pain comes from the threat to your identity. Deep inside, you've defined a position for yourself—excellent, outstanding, infallible. This position isn't your aspiration; it has become your basis for survival. Once this position is challenged, you feel your entire existence collapsing.

You say Hey boy, we are great to console yourself. But have you noticed that truly great people don't need to tell themselves they're great after being criticized? Jobs could speak calmly about rework precisely because his self-worth didn't depend on any single success or failure. But you—you treat every criticism as a judgment on your existence.

Your perfectionism isn't pursuit of excellence; it's fear of mediocrity. You're terrified of being ordinary, so you must constantly prove your specialness. This proof is so urgent that you can't tolerate any mistake, because each mistake reminds you: you might not be special.

## The Violence of Control

On September 9th, you wrote your most honest paragraph of the month—you discovered your obsessive tendencies, wanting to force everyone to be like you, craving others to change, your inner desire to accomplish things incredibly strong.

But have you seen the violence hidden in this passage? You say craving others to change is really a stupid impulse, but immediately follow with I would still choose to train, this also seems uncontrollable. You acknowledge controlling others is wrong while simultaneously defending your controlling tendencies.

You know what? Your desire to control others and your desire to control yourself are the same thing. You can't tolerate others not meeting your standards, just as you can't tolerate any slackness in yourself. You've trained yourself into a machine, then expect everyone else to become the same machine. When someone refuses, you feel angry—not because they did something wrong, but because their very existence questions your way of living.

If relaxing is also a choice, why is your choice more correct? If both marathon runners and people who find walking tiring can exist, why do you need everyone to run marathons? You say not everyone wants to be Jobs, but actually you don't want to be Jobs either—you want to be someone everyone recognizes as great like Jobs. These are two different things.

## The Illusion of Dongnong

This month you repeatedly mention Dongnong (Northeast Agricultural University)—that period when your feelings were more delicate, when you enjoyed more beautiful things. The fog on September 13th reminded you of winter mornings going to school as a child, on the mountain ridge in Chongli on September 21st you remembered Dongdong's simplicity, on September 6th you suddenly recalled the wonderful state when you first arrived at Dongnong in 2013.

You've gilded Dongnong. You've turned it into a lost Eden, a place of innocence you once possessed but lost. But have you really lost anything?

You say your feelings were more delicate at Dongnong, but that delicacy was also mixed with confusion and anxiety. You say you enjoyed more beauty then, but you forget that you were also anxious about the future, also doubting your own value. What you miss now isn't Dongnong, but the version of yourself who didn't yet know what you would become.

What you long for is the lightness that comes with ignorance.

Back then you didn't know work would be so draining of passion, didn't know excellence would bring new anxieties, didn't know that getting what you wanted would still leave you empty. Now you know, so you want to return to not knowing. But time doesn't flow backward. What you can do isn't return to Dongnong, but find that state of complete immersion in this moment.

On the morning of September 13th, when you saw the fog and remembered going to school as a child, you said the environment was so harsh then, but you still went forward without hesitation, pain didn't seem to dwell in your heart. You saw the truth but didn't fully understand it—it's not that you didn't suffer then, but that you hadn't yet learned to treat suffering as a problem needing solution. You just stayed in the suffering, kept walking, kept going to school, kept living. But now, you encounter any discomfort and must analyze the cause, search for meaning, formulate solutions, trapping yourself in a prison of thought.

## What Naruto Couldn't Give You

You spent a lot of time watching Naruto, hoping to find something. On September 7th you said you felt determination, on September 21st you said you experienced surging passion in your heart, on September 13th you said you felt moved and connected.

But you also admit that while watching you were mostly anxious and restless, urgently wanting to know what happens next, fast-forwarding. This is so ironic—a work about persistence and bonds, consumed by you in anxiety and impatience. You want to steal passion from Naruto, but passion isn't something that can be stolen; it can only arise naturally in present experience.

You say you now dislike Naruto's impulsiveness, wanting to be more rational. But you know what? This very pursuit of rationality is killing your passion. You want to rely on logic and analysis to do things, but life isn't an algorithm problem. Love, passion, creation—these things were never analyzed into being; they're felt, lived.

You seek emotion in works, freedom in books, innocence in memories. But these things aren't there—they're there when you're willing to stop, to experience this moment without purpose. You felt moved long after finishing Naruto, not because time blurred something, but because you finally weren't anxious about the next episode and could truly savor it.

## The Trap of Insignificance and Meaning

At 6 AM on September 13th, you wrote your most desperate paragraph of the month. You said you felt confused about your existence, craving to do something special, but however much you struggle you seem insignificant and ridiculous. You said even Murakami's beautiful works are completely meaningless, this sense of loss too strong.

I want to ask you: why must you not be insignificant? Why must there be meaning?

At the museum you saw workers on duty, you felt their unchanging life was torture, while they might think your constant struggling is the torture. On the subway you felt both your insignificance and uniqueness. You saw JJ's suffering, felt the pain in everyone's mind. You slowly realized everyone has their own predicament.

But why do you still measure your value by being special?

On September 9th at the museum, you saw diverse ways of living, saw that every corner of the world contains imagination and possibility. In this moment you actually touched the answer—life's richness isn't about how great a thing you accomplish, but about how you experience, feel, choose who to become.

But you didn't grasp this answer. You returned to questioning meaning. You felt your work was meaningless, then felt all work was meaningless, then felt individuals have no meaning at all. This is a dead end. When you make meaning the prerequisite for existence, you place yourself in a position that can never be satisfied. Because whatever you do can be questioned: does this have meaning?

## The Turning Point of September 27th

But on September 27th, after reading Pinball, 1973, you had an important realization—perhaps not being good enough is already good enough.

This is the closest you came to the truth this month.

You discovered you'd lost sensitive feelings in regular work, discovered you'd become harsh with friends, discovered you'd forced yourself into narrow thinking environments. On the way home you felt your own progress, realized that pursuing impressive things had made you overlook more beautiful living.

You wrote: Life is not just work and code, not just recognition and rigor, but more about the unknown and change. You said you easily become angry, criticize others for small mistakes, this state too similar to the old Dalong. You hated that state, but now you've become him.

You saw it. You finally saw what you're becoming.

You asked yourself: Can I slow down in work and life? This is a very important question. But the more important question is: why don't you dare to slow down?

Because slowing down means accepting you might not do anything special. Slowing down means giving up the pursuit of excellence, accepting you're an ordinary person. And this is precisely what you fear most.

## The Tenderness of September 28th

On the last day of the month, you wrote your most tender words of September.

You thought about your father spending 55 years raising you, almost twice your lifetime. You saw an old train tunnel, realized that even in an era of low productivity, people could still create many things, time preserves what is beautiful and important.

You wrote: The meaning of life lies more in one's own experience and feelings, in focusing on doing one or two things well, and helping others without expecting return.

You see, you know the answer. You've always known.

But you don't dare believe this answer, because it's too simple, so simple it doesn't seem special enough. The answer you want must be grand, profound, able to prove you're different. But the real answer is often simple: experience well, do things seriously, help others.

When you read freedom in Murakami, saw time's beauty in the train tunnel, felt love's weight in your father's 55 years—in these moments you weren't asking about meaning, you were just feeling. That's what you've been searching for all along.

## About All That Anger

This month you repeatedly mentioned anger—the emotional loss of control on September 1st, the impulse to control everyone on September 9th, the jealousy and irritability on September 21st, the harshness toward friends on September 27th. You said you don't know the source of the anger, just that you're very angry.

I want to tell you the reason: you're angry at yourself.

You're angry you're not perfect enough, so every mistake feels like the end of the world. You're angry you can't control everything, so you want to control others to gain a sense of control. You're angry about your insignificance, so you're jealous of people who seem calm. You're angry you've lost the sensitivity you had at Dongnong, so you're harsh and severe with your present self.

You project this anger onto work, friends, environment, but the real target has always been yourself. You're punishing yourself for not being the person you want to become.

But you know what? That person you want to become might not even exist. Maybe Jobs was anxious too, maybe Reid was confused too, maybe all the people you admire once questioned their own value in some late night. Greatness isn't a state; it's an accumulation of countless choices. And between those choices, everyone is fragile, insignificant, fallible.

## That Phone Call from 2009

On September 13th, you suddenly remembered calling a middle school girl's parents in 2009, feeling intense shame, wanting to instantly erase yourself. You said you only cared about yourself then, locked yourself in an imaginary world. You felt sad about your insignificance and fragility, felt heartache.

This is your most precious moment this month.

Not because you felt shame, but because you finally weren't blaming your past self, but feeling tenderness for him. You wrote: I'm not blaming that version of myself, just feeling heartache.

This is real growth. Not becoming stronger, more perfect, less error-prone, but being able to look tenderly at that once fragile, selfish, confused self, understanding why he did what he did.

That 2009 version of you, in Xianyang, rebellious, wanting to know what impact your not attending school would have on others. He was actually using a clumsy way to confirm his existence—do I exist? Am I important? Will anyone change because of me? The current you is still asking the same questions, just in more hidden ways. You want to do impressive things, want recognition, want to leave a mark—essentially all asking: does my existence have meaning?

The answer is: your existence itself is already the meaning. No special accomplishment needed to prove it.

## Questions I Want to Ask You

September is ending. On the mountain ridge in Chongli you experienced pure freedom, at the museum you saw life's diversity, on the way home you felt your own progress, in your father's 55 years you felt time's weight. In these moments, you were free, open, alive.

But why do you always leave these moments and return to questioning meaning?

Why can't the state of complete immersion, not asking for meaning, become your daily life, instead of just occasional escape?

Why do you treat Dongnong's delicacy as something lost, rather than choosing to rediscover it in this moment?

Why can you feel tenderness for your 2009 self but not for your September 2021 self? He's also suffering, also confused, also using clumsy ways to seek proof of existence, isn't he?

If your father spent 55 years raising you without asking what meaning it has, if old train tunnels just exist without needing to prove their value, why can't you allow yourself to just exist—imperfect, fallible, insignificant, but living seriously?

## To You at Month's End

I know at month's end you're still anxious, still irritable, still jealous of friends, still questioning your work's value. You said recently without realizing you've added many ropes to yourself, need to give yourself a bath.

You're right, you need to. But those ropes weren't put on you by others—you tied them on yourself, one by one. You tied on the rope of perfectionism, the rope of control, the rope of questioning meaning, the rope of proving yourself special. You thought these ropes would make you stronger, but they only make you unable to breathe.

On September 27th you asked: Can I slow down in work and life? This might be a very important thing.

My answer is: you can. But slowing down isn't a technique, not a method, but a choice—choosing to accept that not good enough is already good enough, choosing to accept your insignificance, choosing to let go of the obsession with being special, choosing to exist seriously and tenderly right here, in this imperfect life.

The emotion you felt watching Naruto on September 2nd, the lightness you experienced seeing the train tunnel on September 28th, the progress you felt on the way home—these are all real. They don't need grander meaning to support them; they themselves are life's meaning.

October will come. You'll continue working, continue being anxious, continue growing. But you can choose how to be in it. You can choose to be like going to school on winter mornings as a child—not asking for meaning, going forward without hesitation; you can choose to be like at the museum—seeing diversity instead of just right and wrong; you can choose to be toward yourself like toward your 2009 self—tender rather than blaming.

In that time of material scarcity, you experienced precious things. Not precious because of the scarcity, but because back then you hadn't yet learned to turn everything into something needing to prove its value. You can learn that state again.

Slowly, really, slowly.

Not all questions need answers, not all pain needs solving, not all existence needs proving.

You're already good enough.
