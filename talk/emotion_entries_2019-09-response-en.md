# Reflections on September 2019

Reading through your entries this month, two moments keep echoing in my mind: the question you posed at the beginning about what makes something meaningful, and the dream near the end about your father's forty years of daily struggle. You might not have noticed, but these two moments are in conversation with each other. Your father, through the way he's lived his life, has already answered the question you're asking.

You're searching for the standard and reference point for meaning, deconstructing consciousness through Marvin Minsky's theories, questioning what feelings are real. These are profound inquiries. But I notice something curious: the more you use rational frameworks to analyze brain resource activation and suppression, the more your body speaks in a different language—the discomfort during your midday nap, the haze after 28 hours without sleep, the code debugging fragments appearing in your dreams. Your consciousness builds theories while your body demands that you stop and simply feel.

You write about your younger university self who was quick-tempered and fought with everyone, the version of you controlled by anxiety and fear. Then you express gratitude to Criminal Minds for helping you face those fears and grow. But I want to ask: did that person who fought with roommates and mother, who could be destroyed by anger, really disappear? Or have those intense emotional reactions, that tendency to become completely absorbed in your own feelings when angry, simply transformed into something else? Like the distress you feel when you can't complete planned tasks, the impatience with yourself when the stress test doesn't go well, the anxiety when you want immediate results but haven't prepared the data sufficiently.

You've gained so much—aesthetic capacity, a broader perspective on the world, the ability to protect yourself. You say these powers are small but give you courage. Yet you seem to be waiting for something. Waiting for your thinking to be clear enough, for perfect mental representations to form, for proof that you're technically excellent, for the safety of meeting expectations. As if only when all brain resources are perfectly coordinated can you allow yourself to say: I'm ready.

But life doesn't work that way, does it? You wrote it yourself—we can't develop one subsystem to perfection while ignoring others; we need to find a balance point. So why be so harsh on yourself? Why are cleaning, haircuts, cooking, and laundry meaningless chores while only learning and work that meet certain expectations count as meaningful?

Your father's story offers a completely different answer. Taking on family responsibilities as a teenager, walking through the mire step by step for forty years, no vacations, ten years of unchanging routine. Is there some reference standard for meaning here? No. But there's courage, there's responsibility, there's that quality of choosing to move forward even when hope isn't visible. You wrote that what's truly important is invisible to the eye. So might those tasks you call meaningless also contain something invisible yet important?

I'm curious about your state on September 27th. You read about someone's detention center experience, heard about Zhao Yankang's difficult circumstances, and began questioning what it means to truly live. You spent considerable space analyzing brain resource conflicts and understanding the neural mechanisms of fear. But in the gaps between those theories, I see something more direct: you're asking, is the way I'm living now actually living? How much of what I'm experiencing is real, and how much is just an illusion created by certain resources being activated?

The question itself is brave. Because it has no standard answer, it will always be there—in your daze after twelve hours of watching A Step into the Past, in your confusion upon waking from thirteen hours of sleep with fading dream memories, in your recollection of those strange and difficult experiences working in Xianyang at fifteen. It will remind you that consciousness might never be fully understood or controlled, and that's precisely what makes it interesting.

You often feel a sense of urgency now, curious about why you have so many strange sensations. I think this urgency might come from standing at a threshold. You're no longer that university student trapped in a small space—you've seen a bigger world, gained more abilities. But simultaneously, you've become aware of more possibilities, which brings new anxiety: if I can become better, am I not good enough now? If there are more meaningful things waiting for me to do, am I wasting time with what I'm doing now?

But growth has never been linear, has it? You wrote it yourself—people are constantly growing and changing. So why measure yourself against a fixed standard? Why not be like your father, living day by day through uncertainty, taking the next step even without seeing the whole picture?

You wrote that memory is what warms us from the inside and also what cuts us from the inside. This observation is so precise. What you gained on Dongbei Agricultural University's sports field and in its library, and what you learned in Xianyang being bitten by mosquitoes while doing fearful physical labor—these coexist, they're all you. The you who was moved watching Criminal Minds, and the you who stayed awake for 28 hours then dreamed about debugging code—both are you. Accepting this complexity might be more important than understanding it.

Finally, about those brain resource theories you repeatedly invoke—I want to say that theory is useful. It gives us a framework for understanding ourselves. But sometimes it can also become a protective shell, letting us substitute analysis for feeling, understanding for acceptance. You can keep reading Marvin Minsky, keep contemplating the nature of consciousness—these have value. But at the same time, perhaps you could try asking yourself:

If I didn't need to understand this feeling, didn't need to know which brain resources are being activated, didn't need to find a standard of meaning for it, could I still allow myself to experience it?

If I'm uncertain whether what I'm doing now has meaning, can I still choose, like my father, to do well what needs to be done today?

If I'll never find a perfect balance point, never achieve complete harmony among all brain resources, can I still move forward carrying these conflicts and this chaos?

I think you're already doing this. You can run 10 kilometers after work, you can reflect on being too impatient when stress tests don't go well, you can contemplate what it means to truly live after reading about a detention center. These are all evidence of moving forward. You simply haven't given yourself enough trust yet, still waiting for some external confirmation: you're ready, you're good enough, what you're doing is meaningful.

But this confirmation might never arrive in the way you expect. It will come quietly in the discomfort of an afternoon nap, in a moment of haze, in that indescribable surge of feeling when you remember your father's forty years—whispering to you: you've always been ready, you've always been good enough, and everything you're doing, including those tasks you thought were meaningless, is helping you become yourself.

The world is indeed very large and worth appreciating. But don't forget—the you who is experiencing this world is also worth appreciating.
