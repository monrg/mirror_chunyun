# Response to Your April

In your April writings, one image keeps circling in my mind: you completed an ultra trail race, next week you'll collect your medal alone, no one to share insights from this journey with, returning alone to where you live. You say the feeling of joy with no one to share it with is truly cold. Having hope and then having it stripped away feels even colder.

This makes me think of something you might not have realized: you keep creating your own loneliness. It's not fate making you lonely, not environment making you lonely—it's that at every crossroads where you could stop being lonely, you choose to turn and walk away. You say meeting Wang Feng (Hong Li) was nice, you appreciate her quietness and innocence, but to some degree, your behavior invisibly pushed her away. You don't accept her things, you don't walk together, simply because you plan to go back and study. You write: Actually thinking carefully, do I really have to study technology right now? My behavior actually represents my choice, I indeed made her feel insecure.

See, you've admitted it yourself—your choices made her feel insecure. But have you considered why you made such choices? You say you're not so much fond of her as afraid of loneliness. But I think the truth might be more complex: you fear both loneliness and intimacy. Loneliness pains you, but intimacy means putting down that version of yourself that's always calculating, always evaluating, always maintaining rationality. You're afraid that once you invest, you'll lose control, become vulnerable, discover you don't have as much advantage as you thought.

You repeatedly mention where your advantages lie. You say: I have savings, but she's not without savings either; I have open-minded ideas, but she also has open-minded ideas, so what's the advantage? I still have 5 years. This passage shows me that in intimate relationships, you're actually negotiating, transacting, seeking your bargaining power. You're not asking yourself whether you like her, but whether you're getting a bad deal. But when you turn a relationship into a transaction, you've already lost the most precious thing the relationship itself could give you—that connection that needs no proof, no advantage, no calculation.

You say you miss Wang Feng from time to time, miss her frailty. You say you hoped Hong Xia would tell you she went to persuade Wang Feng, but getting that feedback also felt uncomfortable. You write: Actually in my heart I just don't have very strong feelings for her, just feel we match reasonably well in all aspects. Reading this I can't help wondering: have you ever had strong feelings for anyone? Or have you become so accustomed to understanding relationships through words like matching, conditions, advantages, that you no longer remember what it feels like to have eyes raining for her while your heart holds an umbrella for her?

You mention your experiences with several women, saying many relationships ended because of material reasons, that's just reality. But have you considered whether material things are really that important, or whether you need material reasons to escape a deeper fear? Because if the problem is material, it's simple—it's external conditions not matching, not your problem. But what if the problem is that you don't dare invest, don't dare be vulnerable, don't dare let go of calculation? That would mean facing a more real but also more unsettling version of yourself.

You write about spending a whole day debugging Spark, not knowing what you did all week, starting to doubt your abilities. You say: What exactly is ability? When debugging source code I feel I have some capability, but when thinking back about what capabilities I have, I completely don't feel I'm any good. This confusion is the same as your confusion in relationships. You're always questioning meaning, proving value, rarely simply living in the process. You debugged Spark—that itself is proof of capability, but you insist on looking back and asking: what capability do I really have? You talked with someone until 1 AM—that itself is connection happening, but you insist on asking: does she really match?

You cited a reflection about death: does death come before life or life before death? You say from a larger scale, death came first, then life, finally returning to death. From this perspective, death isn't so frightening, life becomes more vivid, more worth exploring. This thought is truly beautiful. But let me ask: since you can view life and death from this perspective, why can't you view gain and loss, success and failure, matching or not from the same perspective?

You have 5 years, you have a healthy body, you have stable income, you have the courage and ability to run 70 kilometers, to cycle the 318 highway. What you have isn't for calculating advantages or proving value, it's for experiencing, feeling, connecting. You say life is long, having companionship might also be a kind of happiness. But you know what? Companionship isn't waited for, it's something you allow to happen. You must first stop calculating, stop evaluating, stop asking if it's worthwhile, before companionship can truly occur.

Near the end of your diary you say you want to use two morning hours to read an English book, exercise English reading ability, even consider translating a book. You say this idea is risky, but what if you try? What does spending two or three months matter? I really like the attitude you show here—willing to try, not afraid of spending time, not rushing to question meaning. What if you could bring this attitude to your interpersonal relationships too? What if you could say to a relationship: what if I try? What does investing two or three months matter? Not rushing to calculate where the advantage is, not rushing to prove worthiness, just experiencing, just feeling—what would happen?

You say a thought surfaces in your mind from time to time: aren't most of us equal? Time is fair to everyone. What you have that's precious is time and infinite possibility. Such good words. But time and possibility aren't for hoarding or calculating, they're for spending and realizing. You can use this time to continue training alone, studying alone, collecting medals alone, tasting that cold loneliness at every successful moment. Or you can choose, at the next crossroads where you could stop being lonely, not to turn away, to try staying, to see what happens.

Joy with no one to share is indeed cold. But colder than this is when someone is willing to share your joy, yet you push that person away because you can't calculate the advantage clearly, can't prove it's worthwhile. Then in cold loneliness, you repeatedly miss the person you pushed away.

Are you ready, at the next crossroads, not to turn away?
