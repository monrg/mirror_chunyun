# An October Dialogue: On Smallness and Vastness

The October you is like someone who just surfaced for air. Those twelve days back home weren't rest—they were a struggle between drowning and breathing. You saw things that Beijing's rapid pace efficiently obscures, and these very things unsettled you.

## What You've Seen But Haven't Fully Articulated

"The ten-plus days at home passed in a blink, and these four days back in Beijing also passed in a blink"—this reveals not just wonder at time's passage, but a deeper fear: no matter where you are, time flows at the same rapid pace, and you can't determine which flow is more real.

Back home, you saw decaying water channels, dilapidated buildings, population exodus. But what truly unsettled you wasn't this physical decline—it was the sudden realization that only a thin layer of contingency separates you from these things. If you hadn't chosen to learn programming back then, if you hadn't caught the internet boom's tail wind, you might be here too, living what you now consider an "unbearable" life.

What disturbs you even more: those living this life aren't as miserable as you imagine. Your uncle, grandmother, the vendors and drivers—they have their own rhythms, their own happiness. This shatters a secret belief propping up your "striving": that you must escape a certain kind of life to find happiness.

But if happiness doesn't depend on life's form, what do these eight years of effort mean?

## The Real Conflict You're Experiencing

October contains a core contradiction you repeatedly touch but don't name: you crave "control," yet increasingly see that control itself is an illusion.

You write "our perception of time is limited by the pattern recognizers in our brain." You understand time is subjective, consciousness is limited, free will might be a fiction. But while understanding this, you still set goals, make plans, track progress daily—because not doing so would feel like losing control.

This isn't hypocrisy; this is the fundamental paradox of human existence. We need to believe in things we know might not be true to continue living. As you said, "consciousness is a mechanism to maintain psychological stability."

But in October you touched a deeper layer of this paradox: if control is illusion, then "letting go of control" is another form of control. You can't truly achieve "going with the flow" because "going with the flow" itself is a choice, a strategy.

The real question isn't how to choose control or release, but: after knowing all this, how do you continue to live authentically?

## A Fact You May Have Overlooked

You repeatedly emphasize "cherishing"—cherishing technical skills, exercise habits, current work. But behind "cherishing" hides an assumption: these things might be lost.

What you fear isn't losing these specific skills or habits, but losing the ability to "cherish" itself. You fear that one day, deadlifting 150kg won't excite you, finishing an English book will leave you unmoved, watching code successfully run will feel only numb.

This worry has legitimacy. You are indeed losing something—you say you no longer have the intense emotional fluctuations of university days, your desire for romance has weakened, movies don't move you as before.

But what you haven't fully realized: you're simultaneously gaining something. You've gained the ability to quickly adjust after being hit, to understand the same thing from multiple angles, to make decisions amid uncertainty.

This isn't becoming better or worse. This is aging.

Aging isn't linear decline but a trade-off. You exchange some intensity of feeling for some stability and insight. The key is: can you accept this exchange rather than perpetually mourning the lost parts?

## A Question You Haven't Faced

Throughout October, you've been avoiding a question: what if you fail the exam?

You've prepared many explanations—"failure is also an option," "the process matters," "at least I trained my English." These are all true, but peripheral defenses.

The real question is: if you fail, can you resist interpreting it as "I'm not smart enough" or "I didn't work hard enough," and simply accept the fact of "didn't pass this time"? Can you, after failure, still believe you're worthy of love, worthy of exploration, worthy of existence?

This is what the exam really tests. Not knowledge, not ability, but your degree of self-acceptance.

You write "human growth isn't linear like filling a container, but forgetting some things while remembering others." This is profound insight. So what if the exam is what you need to forget? Forgetting it isn't failure—it's just the brain reallocating resources.

## Questions for You

During meditation, you felt "being in an extremely vast dark space, sensing expansion toward depth." This experience is important because it touches what you've been exploring—the nature of consciousness.

But have you considered: might your obsession with "exploring consciousness" itself be another escape? Escaping what? Escaping a simpler, more direct life.

If one day you discover consciousness is just random neural firing with no deeper meaning, will you be disappointed? Or relieved?

You spend extensive time pondering time, space, consciousness, AI, the universe—all good. But have you given yourself enough time to just sit there, feel autumn wind on your face, without analyzing it, without assigning meaning?

You mention kittens can "easily merge with the natural environment." Perhaps what humans lost isn't ability but necessity. We don't need to merge because we can transform. But in transforming, we forgot how merging feels.

Thirty-one is not life's midpoint, not a watershed, not anything symbolically significant. It's just your 31st orbit around this star. If you could see it this way, much anxiety would vanish.

One final question: you've written so much about "authenticity," but do you dare live an "inauthentic" life? Dare you admit that perhaps life itself has no true or false, only what you choose to assign it?
