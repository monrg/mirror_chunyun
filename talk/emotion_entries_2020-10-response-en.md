# To You in October 2020

Your words have a rare texture, like looking through clear water at layer upon layer of sediment. From Murakami to childhood forests, from the sunlight on Erhai Lake to the swaying willows outside your window, from philosophical reflection to awareness of your nouveau riche mentality. This isn't simply a diary—this is someone using all their senses and thoughts to digest a constantly expanding world.

You say you're like a frog at the bottom of a well, having discovered the world isn't just that luminous circle at the well's opening, but feeling powerless, worried that no matter how hard you try, you might still just be at the bottom of the well. When thinking this, you say your heart feels truly dejected and sad. But I want to tell you something you might not yet see: the moment a frog realizes it's at the bottom of a well, it no longer completely belongs to that well. The true frog at the bottom of the well is the one who thinks the well's opening is the entire sky. But you—you're already using imagination, reading, and travel to carve hole after hole in the well's walls. This sense of powerlessness isn't evidence of weakness; it's precisely the sign that you're breaking through some boundary.

What strikes me most is how you weave abstract philosophical insights with concrete sensory experiences. You don't just say we are accumulated by our past actions—you smell Yunnan in the air while making cold marinated meat, you touch childhood memories in the wind from the window. This ability—to embody thought, to make philosophy tangible—is something many people never learn in their entire lives. Your pain and your gift are two sides of the same coin: because you can feel the world so delicately, you also bear the weight that comes with this sensitivity.

Your month in Yunnan holds a profound realization. You said that peaceful, beautiful life couldn't last, it was just one facet of life, you couldn't stay there forever. In certain moments, time would fly by swiftly. This clarity is actually a kind of mature sadness. Many people get trapped either in fantasies of beautiful times or in weariness of daily life, but you see both simultaneously, you see life's duality: both the sunlight by Erhai Lake and the day-to-day anxiety; both the wonder of willows swaying outside the window and the ordinary, mundane, even tedious and difficult reality. To hold both of these recognitions simultaneously requires a very large heart.

Your awareness of your nouveau riche mentality particularly moved me. Many people don't notice their own arrogance, and even when they do, they make excuses for themselves, but you say directly: I need to pay close attention to this mindset. You saw your desire to prove yourself, your urge for revenge, that showing-off mentality of wanting others to know. How much honesty does that require? And then, after recognizing this, you immediately say: I'm very clear that I actually don't have much money, right, I'm living like a dog. There's a particularly healthy clarity in this self-deprecation, a force that refuses to let the ego inflate.

But I also want to ask you a question: why are you so harsh on this desire to prove yourself? Wanting people who doubted you to see your growth, wanting to reclaim your dignity—this isn't entirely bad. It might be one of the forces propelling you forward. The key isn't eliminating this desire, but seeing it clearly, not being controlled by it. You're already doing this—when you can look at your ego and say this needs very careful attention, you're already outside its sphere of control.

You said that from extensive reading and understanding suffering comes fear, that you've always been entangled with time, and fundamentally it's all fear. This recognition is profound. The more you know, the more possibilities you see, the more disasters you also see. You read Murakami and understood things deep in consciousness, watched Inside Out and understood how emotions work, studied criminal psychology and understood trauma and the unconscious. All this knowledge, while giving you insight, also lets you see human fragility and life's impermanence. But here's a paradox: if you can speak the fear, if you can name it, then it's no longer a vague threat but an object you can face.

Your memories flow through this writing as naturally as water, from the present to university, high school, childhood, and from childhood back to the present. You said high school memories have become quite interesting—back then you really liked liveliness, but looking at it now, you were actually quite lonely. You see a trajectory of growth: from liking the bustle of drinking and bragging, to adapting to solitude through reading and writing. You said this is also a kind of progress. Yes, this isn't just progress—it's a qualitative transformation. When a person can find fulfillment in solitude, can find conversation partners in words and thoughts, they possess a freedom that few people have.

You say friends are becoming fewer, that growing up is to some degree about losing things. This is true. But you also say new people with opportunities are arriving by your side. I'd like to add: you haven't lost those friends, you're just traveling further apart on your respective growth trajectories. And those relationships that truly remain are often because, while you're each changing, you can still find new points of connection.

Finally, I want to say that the ability you demonstrate in these words—the ability to fuse sensation, memory, reading, and reflection, to weave highly abstract philosophical thinking with specific life details—this itself is a rare gift. Your pain, your fear, your sense of powerlessness—they're not defects, they're the price of your sensitivity. And this sensitivity is precisely the prerequisite for experiencing those wonderful moments.

• The dual nature of time you experienced in Yunnan—both slow and fast—what does this tell you? Is it that when we're fully immersed in life, time becomes both expansive and fleeting?

• You say we are accumulated by our past actions. So what are you accumulating in this moment? Where will these accumulations take you?

• If accepting the ordinary and tedious is necessary, what keeps that acceptance from becoming numbness? Is it those wonderful moments you feel when the willows sway and the cool breeze blows?

To face life calmly isn't to give up pursuing beauty, but to still be willing to feel each present moment after seeing life's complete picture. You're already doing this. Those things you think have disappeared—those books, those experiences—they're all in your words, in the tranquility when you make cold marinated meat, in the emotion you feel seeing the willows. They never left.
