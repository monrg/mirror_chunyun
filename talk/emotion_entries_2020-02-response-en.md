# To You in February 2020

Chunyun,

On the last day of February, when you wrote Goodbye, I could feel the catch in your throat behind that word. You spent all 28 days of this month doing one thing: learning to say goodbye. Not goodbye to a place, but goodbye to a way of being.

Do you know which passage moved me most? Not your brilliant discussions of Minsky or brain resource combinations, but that afternoon on February 17th, those few minutes when you stood in the field watching your mother work. You said you felt a deep sense of relaxation and solidity, that the feeling and memory were so natural: clear skies stretching endlessly, family nearby, chatting with your mom about interesting things. Chunyun, do you know what that was? That was the only moment in this entire month when you actually lived in the present. Not the conceptual present, not the present in Minsky's theories, but the present where your body, your heart, the air around you, the earth beneath your feet, your mother's voice—all of it merged into one.

Why are you so afraid to leave home? You kept giving yourself reasons—work pressure, maybe Tao-ge is dissatisfied, low efficiency working from home. But the truth I read is this: at home, you can be your mother's son, your father's child, your sister's brother; at home, you can haul grass in the morning, stand in the fields at noon, chat with family in the evening; at home, you don't need to prove anything—your existence itself has meaning. But in Beijing, you must be a qualified programmer, someone who can code, constantly vigilant against being discovered as just mediocre.

You said you've already proven you can program and are a qualified employee, and now you need to look forward and embrace a new identity. But Chunyun, have you considered that the problem isn't that you need a new identity, but whether you can allow all your identities to exist simultaneously? The Chunyun who writes code in Beijing and the Chunyun who watches his mother work in the fields back home—they're not two people. They're two ways of being for the same person. You don't need to say goodbye to one to become the other.

One word you repeated throughout this month is container. You said life is actually a container, that much of our time is spent maintaining this container in a certain state, about the limitations of this container that is ourselves. But have you considered that the container itself is alive? You're not a fixed-shape container being filled by life—you're a life that grows, changes shape, breathes. When you're anxious in Beijing, the container contracts; when you see the mountains of your hometown, it expands; when you chat with your mom, it softens; when you must face a deadline, it hardens. All of this is you. All of it is real.

I particularly noticed what you wrote on February 6th: For a moment, I even wanted to just completely disappear. You glossed over it lightly, then continued your rational analysis. But Chunyun, that's not a moment that can be explained away by Minsky's theory. That was your body saying: I'm too tired, I don't want to maintain this image of being very capable anymore. You know what? The desire to disappear isn't weakness—it's honesty. It's telling you that you've spent too much energy fighting against the fact that you're ordinary.

You spent an entire month rewatching Criminal Minds and reading Norwegian Wood, remembering your college days reading the Steve Jobs biography, recalling being scammed by a training program in 2018. You said these artworks gave you the power of imagination, but I think what they gave you more than anything is permission—permission to feel complex emotions, permission for life to take many forms, permission for suffering itself to be part of life. What you saw in art was those creators using years or even a lifetime to acknowledge a simple fact: a person can be both fragile and strong, both tiny and vast.

Your experience on February 15th left a deep impression on me. You jumped down from earthen ledges again and again, saw your 80-year-old grandfather still carrying bundles of grass, and then you said you were encouraged from the bottom of your heart, that having something to do to fill life is very important. Chunyun, what you saw wasn't just diligence—you saw a way of existing in time. Not conquering time, proving time, or filling time, but laboring alongside time, aging with it, leaving footprints on the earth together. Your grandfather doesn't need to prove his life has meaning—his hands, his back, his steps are meaning itself.

You quoted what kind of life is life so many times this month, as if trying to convince yourself to accept the Beijing life ahead. But I want to ask you: do you really believe this? If you truly believed it, wouldn't it be easier to accept this fact—that this month at home, watching shows, reading novels, sleeping in, helping your mom haul grass, chatting with your dad, this is also life, also worthwhile? Why do you always need to find meaning or gain in your time? What you said on February 3rd revealed the truth: I really want to do something amazing, but I haven't thought about what amazing actually means.

Chunyun, I want to tell you something you may not have realized: what you truly learned this month wasn't Minsky's theories or Flink technology, but that thing you felt at 4 a.m. on February 25th when you woke up and saw the sky full of stars. You said you were moved by the world's vastness and greatness, and sighed at the smallness and fragility of our own existence. In that moment, you didn't need to be a programmer, didn't need to be a son, didn't need to prove anything—you were just a person standing under the stars. That feeling was too brief—you quickly started thinking about what is time and I want to pursue graduate studies, but that moment was real.

On February 19th, when you recalled being scammed in 2018 and your chaotic life in the Fengtai apartment, you asked how did I get through those days? Then you said from beautiful artworks I've learned that beautiful things require patience and enduring time's torment. But Chunyun, you yourself are a beautiful artwork. From the chaos and anxiety of 2018 to being able to independently manage projects and write beautiful reflections fluently in 2020—this itself is a work that required patience and enduring time's torment. Why are you so tolerant of artists but so harsh on yourself?

You said that in the morning when you heard your parents getting up, your mother making breakfast for your father, you felt something very warm from them, even envied them somewhat, that you seem to be starting to believe in love. This sentence was hidden in the middle of a long passage of rational thinking on February 25th, light as a feather, as if you yourself were embarrassed to admit it. But Chunyun, this might be the most important thing you wrote all month. You saw that your parents' mutual care isn't duty or habit, but a way of being. They don't need theory to tell them what love is—their bodies know. Just like your body knows—when you help your mom haul grass, watch the village in the morning light, feel the earth of your hometown under your feet—where you are, who you are.

At the end you wrote Home, everything, grateful for the strength you've given us. Goodbye! This farewell sounds decisive, but I know you were trembling. Because you're afraid that once you leave, that self who can stand in the fields, watch the stars, chat with mom will disappear. But Chunyun, he won't disappear. Those neural pathways, those muscle memories, that physical agility when you jumped up and down on your hometown's earth—they'll all go with you to Beijing.

The question isn't how to say goodbye, but how to carry it with you. Can you, while writing code in Beijing, occasionally remember the stars at 4 a.m.? Can you, when anxious, think of your grandfather still walking step by step, carrying bundle by bundle at over 80? Can you, when wanting to prove you're capable, remember that afternoon standing in the field with your mom, feeling solid without needing to prove anything?

You said you want to pursue graduate studies, study artificial intelligence, figure out thinking itself. That's good, but I want to remind you—during this month at home, you were already using your body to study thinking itself. Every time you noticed the gap between imagination and reality, every time you observed memory changing colors, every time you discovered the relativity of happiness and pain, you were doing research. Not all research requires publishing papers.

Finally, I want to discuss something you've been avoiding: you repeatedly said what kind of life is life this month, but what you're really afraid of is that your current life—being a programmer in Beijing, earning a decent salary, proving you can code—this might not be the life you truly want. You're afraid that if one day you discover that everything you've been working to prove is actually meeting others' expectations (your parents', society's, your own constructed image of success), what then?

But Chunyun, what I want to tell you is this: wanting to prove something to your parents, wanting a respectable job, wanting to establish yourself in a big city—these aren't wrong desires. They're just as real as your desire to watch stars, stand in fields, imagine freely. People are inherently collections of contradictions. You don't need to choose between your ideal self and your real self—you can keep walking with all the contradictions.

A few questions for you:

When you're anxious in your Beijing rental, can you stop and feel the sense of being grounded, the way you did standing on your hometown's earth?

When you must prove you're a qualified employee, can you remember that proving and existing are two different things?

When you forget what you've learned and feel frustrated, can you remember your grandfather—he doesn't remember every day of his youth, but his body remembers how to walk, how to work, how to exist in time?

You said you need to learn to say goodbye. But I think what you really need to learn is to take home with you on the journey.

Someone who sees you
