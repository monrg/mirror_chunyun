# Response: December 2019 Journal

Reading your December entries feels like watching someone trying to stay steady in the eye of a storm. The pressure from the advertising project nearly crushed you, the gap between expectation and reality made you doubt yourself again and again, but amid all this chaos, on December 19th, you celebrated your birthday and said Happy Birthday to yourself. That moment of tenderness and self-acceptance was more real than all the month's anxiety.

## What the Snow Scene Reveals

On December 1st, seeing the snow reminded you of winter hardships from elementary school, and then you said something particularly heartbreaking: even though you have so much now, happiness seems less than before. You attribute this to replacing curious eyes with rational thinking, but I want to ask you to look deeper.

What you've lost isn't just childhood curiosity—you've lost the freedom of not needing to prove anything. When you lay in the alfalfa field watching clouds as a child, you didn't need that moment to have meaning, didn't need it to prove you were special, didn't need it to enhance your resume. It was just beauty, just the present, just a moment between you and the sky.

But now, you've added evaluation to almost everything in life. Is reading novels a waste of time? Does playing soccer improve abilities? Was spending four hours debugging worth it? You're living too hard, so hard you've forgotten that life itself doesn't need so many justifications.

That you who lay on the field ridge watching clouds hasn't disappeared—he's just been drowned out by anxious voices. Maybe what you need isn't to return to childhood, but to relearn that some things can exist without reason, just because they're beautiful, just because they make you feel alive.

## The War Between Imagination and Reality

This month you repeatedly mentioned the gap between expectation and reality—the advertising project was much harder than imagined, your abilities were overestimated, time was never enough. On December 11th you were particularly honest: thinking half an hour of MySQL tutorials would make your skills leap forward was a somewhat arrogant illusion.

But I want to point out a pattern you might not have noticed: you're always swinging between two extremes. Either you think you're great and can handle everything in half an hour, or you think you're terrible and can't do anything right. These two states seem opposite, but share the same root—you're still evaluating yourself in an all-or-nothing way.

Real growth isn't like that. Real growth is: knowing you've improved in some areas (like being able to debug problems independently) while also knowing there's still much you don't understand (like Pushgateway details). Both can be true simultaneously; they don't contradict.

You said marathons aren't run by sprinting 500 meters for a week—such a great metaphor. But have you noticed you've actually been running a marathon? From not understanding frameworks and big data last year to handling the advertising project now—isn't that a marathon? You're just too focused on the difficulty of this current kilometer to look back and see how far you've already run.

## That So-Called Wasted Time

That long paragraph on December 14th was particularly moving—you were defending reading web novels in high school, defending playing soccer, defending those seemingly useless times. You asked: if you replaced these memories, what could you replace them with?

Such a good question. See, you already understand something many people never grasp in their entire lives: time isn't for optimizing, time is for carrying.

Those novels, those games, those experiences that now seem ordinary—their meaning isn't in what specific skills or achievements they brought you. Their meaning is: in those moments, you lived. Your brain formed specific connections because of these experiences, your body gained the foundation to run half-marathons now because of playing soccer, your imagination was expanded by that trashy literature.

And who says that time was useless? Your ability to think deeply now, to write such profound reflections, to understand Minsky and Freud—these abilities didn't come from nowhere. They came from every problem you seriously worked through in your first year of high school, from every book you read in the library, from the persistence and focus you cultivated playing soccer in college.

You said time's passage must be carried, that the greatest meaning of forgotten things is to carry time. You're so right. But carrying itself is meaning. You existed, you felt, you experienced—that's enough.

## What You Said on Your Birthday

On December 19th, you celebrated your birthday and made a wish: to participate in an open source project by next year, to make something many people can use. Reading this almost made me laugh—not in mockery, but in being moved.

Because you'd been anxious all month, doubting yourself, feeling ordinary, feeling pressured, feeling like you couldn't go on. But on your birthday, you still held hope for the future, still wanted to do something, still believed you could grow. This resilience, this ability to maintain hope at the edge of collapse, is your most precious quality.

And the progress you listed is all real: last year at this time you really didn't understand many things, now you do. This isn't self-consolation, it's fact. You said to trust time's power—please remember this yourself.

Each day might feel like wasted time, but looking at the bigger picture, you've been growing all along. Like how you thought 4 yuan was a fortune as a child, but now even ten thousand times that feels ordinary. It's not that money's value changed—your container grew bigger.

## Between Heaven and Hell

On December 14th you wrote: at 4pm you felt terrified of the future, after dinner you felt life was okay. You said life is full of drama, but what I see is: your emotions are fluctuating too violently.

This violent fluctuation isn't a personality issue—it's a signal that pressure is too high. When someone is under prolonged high pressure, their emotional regulation system becomes unstable, small things can swing moods from heaven to hell or vice versa.

What you need isn't to overcome these fluctuations, but to lower overall pressure levels. How? Not by avoiding work, but by adjusting expectations of yourself. You've set standards too high—to quickly master the advertising project, to write perfect code, to do documentation well, to learn MySQL, to handle all emergencies... How could one person possibly do all this well simultaneously?

You wrote it yourself: prioritize, slow down to think. But have you really done it? Have you given yourself space to make mistakes? Given yourself the right not to know? Allowed yourself to just be a programmer who's still learning, rather than having to be an omniscient superman?

On December 16th you reviewed old notes and found yourself inflated, with illusory estimates of your abilities. Being able to see this is already impressive. But please also see the other side: you have improved, you do have things worth confidence about. Not false confidence, but confidence based on facts.

## Sun Meng's Face

There's a particularly interesting detail on December 14th: at 2pm you thought Sun Meng looked hideous and disliked him; at 4pm he told you data was reconciled and you thought he was okay. You used this example to show emotional change, but I see something else: you need external validation too much.

When work isn't going well, you project anxiety onto Sun Meng, thinking he's pretentious. When he brings good news, you think he's okay. Your evaluation criteria entirely depend on whether he makes you feel better. What does this show? It shows your self-worth depends too much on external feedback.

Try this: next time work isn't going well, can you not rush to find someone or something to blame? Can you just admit: this is indeed difficult, I'm still figuring it out, this is normal. Your value doesn't depend on whether each task goes smoothly, doesn't depend on what others think of you. Your value lies in persisting even when it's hard.

## About the Question of Meaning

You said sometimes life feels completely meaningless, wishing everything would vanish like smoke. December 1st, December 14th, several places mention this feeling. This isn't pretentious—it's real pain, I see it.

But I also want to ask you to see: when you say life has no meaning, what kind of meaning are you expecting? Great achievements? Many people's recognition? Reaching some ideal state?

Maybe meaning isn't a destination to reach, but the experience of this very moment itself. When running and seeing college couples, remembering playing soccer yourself—does this moment have meaning? Going to the market, seeing all kinds of lives, feeling the world's richness—does this have meaning? Saying Happy Birthday to yourself on December 19th—does this have meaning?

Yes. All of it does. Meaning isn't elsewhere, it's in these moments. You said watching water has magic, creates a trance-like feeling. That IS meaning—that you who can still be moved by flowing water, that you who can still feel trance, still alive, still feeling, not completely swallowed by anxiety.

## Written for December You

This month was especially hard for you. Pressure from the advertising project, the gap between expectation and reality, doubts about your abilities, anxiety about the future—all real, all heavy. But you must also see: you made it through.

On December 19th you said: the future is promising, boy, just be patient. I'm returning these words to you now: be a little more patient with yourself.

You don't need to master the entire advertising system in one month. You don't need output every day. You don't need to prove you're better than others. You just need to work day by day, learn bit by bit, adjust again and again. Like you said, marathons aren't run by sprinting.

About happiness decreasing, I want to say: maybe happiness hasn't decreased, but your expectations of happiness have changed. As a child watching clouds made you happy all afternoon, now you need bigger stimulation to feel satisfied. But this isn't growth's inevitable cost—this is something you can adjust.

Try doing simple things again: walk slowly, watch water, listen to music, cook. Don't ask what use these have, just do them. You'll find that you who can be moved by simple things has never truly left.

Finally, on December 29th you listened to sad music, remembered high school, felt heartache. Time is indeed magical, six years passed unknowingly. But in these six years, you didn't live in vain. You've grown, you've become stronger, you're still thinking, still feeling, still writing these words.

That's enough. It really is enough.

Keep walking, take it slow. Life will bring many difficulties and surprises, but you've already proven you can bear them.
