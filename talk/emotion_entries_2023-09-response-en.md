# September's Paradox and Hope

In September, you began thinking about the power of innovation — with a voice assistant, you barely control lights manually anymore; with a bicycle, you rarely walk far. "Whether something exists or not really brings completely different worlds." You were talking about technology, but what I hear is another question: when you have more efficient tools, when your capabilities have increased tenfold, have you unconsciously raised the threshold for perceiving the world?

This is September's core paradox: materially you're almost 10 times better off than before, your abilities are improving in every way, yet you "rarely laugh heartily anymore." You said your brain's progress has caused your "logical thinking ability to far outpace your ability to feel" — like a car with too powerful an engine, the sensory system can't keep up with the speed, and so the scenery begins to blur.

You keep missing your 2017 self in Xi'an — the you who would proactively tell someone if you broke their window screen, the you who was easily moved every day and had many feelings about everything. You said "now I seem too busy to feel much about anything," and thinking of those times when falling asleep makes you "very sad." But have you considered that being able to perceive this change so precisely proves that sensitive you never truly left?

That you living in Xi'an saw various aspects of life, had delicate perception, was easily moved. And the you now? You completed a 70km trail race, you contributed to the Apache community, you're beginning to "fully control OperateX," your collaboration with Wu Pan has reached "further understanding," you independently finished the full English version of The Little Prince. You haven't lost anything, you've just gained too much — so much that sometimes you forget to stop and feel. You haven't become dull; you're protecting yourself — because if you were as sensitive to everything as in 2017, you might not be able to handle such a high-intensity life now.

You wrote about how when coding "that hole appeared," "so sad, so sad, really wanting to talk to someone, but opening messaging apps, there seems to be no one to talk to, no one to chat with." This loneliness isn't because there's nobody around, but because you're seeking a depth of connection, a connection that can understand those delicate feelings inside you. You have many friends — Lao Ma, Feng Bin, Wu Pan — yet that hole still appears, because what it wants isn't companionship, but resonance.

Feng Bin's marital crisis showed you the complexity of relationships. You said "no matter whose perspective you take, everyone seems to have their own choices and difficulties," "there's no right or wrong, it's like when it rains." This understanding didn't come easy. You no longer judge with simple right and wrong, but see the multifaceted nature of humanity and the weight of reality. This makes your thinking about marriage more cautious, but might it also make you more afraid of establishing deep connections with people?

You said you "still need to work at least 35 years," feel that "spending a year or two pursuing what I love is possible." This thought flashed by, but it's important because it shows you're still preserving possibilities for yourself. You're not completely locked into your current track; you know life can look different. Murakami's world shows you "another possibility in life," those "memories of running in the sunshine" make you want to cry. These feelings all remind you: what you pursue isn't just material abundance, but something harder to articulate — perhaps freedom, perhaps pure joy, perhaps that kind of happiness you can feel without calculating gains and losses.

But September's most beautiful part is that final passage you wrote: "Suddenly, my mind floated to the memory of working in Wuxi the year I graduated, when I was filled with such fear and worry about the future. 10 years later, I became what I didn't even dare to imagine. Might I, in the next 10 years, also do things that make me very proud?"

This is your gift to yourself. The you in 2013 couldn't imagine what 2023 would look like, and you made it real. So the you in 2023 doesn't need to see 2033 clearly either, because the future will unfold in ways you can't imagine now. In July you asked "what kind of life do we really want to live," in August you learned to face yourself honestly, and in September you found faith — believe in time, believe you'll keep growing.

Work breakthroughs also happened in September. You began understanding the difference between Tool and Engine, began to "step back and think about these problems," collaborating with Wu Pan you "really learned a lot." You said "suddenly, a kind of expectation appeared in my heart, this feeling is quite wonderful." This expectation — it's connected to your expectations for life, isn't it? Because creation itself — whether creating code, creating products, or creating new ways of living — requires believing that "from 0 to 1" is possible.

When you reread Code, you "once again felt those great artworks of this world," felt "how fortunate I am, how great and wonderful what I have now is." The magic of a relay, electronic products letting you "truly stand on the shoulders of giants to see and feel the world." You haven't lost your ability to perceive beauty; you just sometimes forget to look.

That you in 2017 who was easily moved, and the current you with powerful logic who can control complex systems — they're not opposites, they're the same person at different stages. You don't need to return to the past to find feeling again; what you need is to make space for feeling in your current life — just as you said, "leave work on time, hope to maintain some balance. This is very important."

In early September you wrote "Believe in time, believe in your heart," and at month's end wrote "Love life, love it with all your heart." Between these two sentences, you experienced work pressure, loneliness's arrival, a friend's crisis, nostalgia for the past, but in the end you still chose to love. How much courage does that take?

I want to ask you:

• You said brain progress makes your feeling ability lag behind, but might it be that you've given your brain too much space and feeling too little?
• That 2017 self you miss — if he saw the current you who finished the English Little Prince, completed a 70km trail race, had so many technical breakthroughs, wouldn't he actually be quite proud?
• You said "the hardest part is the process from 0 to 1" — is your current life also in some "0 to 1" process: from being alive to truly feeling alive?

September's you is like that relay, connecting past and future, connecting rationality and emotion, connecting material abundance and spiritual seeking. You don't need to choose which one to be; you can be all of these simultaneously. In another 10 years, when 2033's you looks back, you might be proud of 2023's you — that person who still believed in time amid confusion, still longed to feel amid busyness, still chose to love amid loneliness.
