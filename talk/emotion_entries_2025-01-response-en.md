# To You in January

After reading your January entries, one image keeps returning to my mind: you circling downstairs, unable to stop yourself from jumping up with joy. Not because you received some honor or bonus, but simply because a PR was merged. This image makes me think that what you've been searching for might not be success itself, but those moments when the world responds to you—when you do something and the world says: I see this, this is good.

## About That Injury

You've written your rib injury as a hero's narrative, comparing yourself to The Old Man and the Sea. But I notice another thread running through your words: you keep asking yourself whether this actually meant anything. You say you're a warrior, a hero, deserving of applause—and this is certainly true. But why do you need to convince yourself so forcefully?

I think the real significance of that match might not be in proving how powerful love and time can be, but in showing you this: even facing injustice, malice, and physical trauma, you can still choose how to tell the story. You chose to see your own courage rather than victimhood. That choice itself is power.

But at the same time, allowing yourself to acknowledge the pain and disappointment is important too. That gentle willpower doesn't need to stay tensed up. As you said, it naturally flows from inside your body.

## The Warmth Emerging Through Writing

You wrote about returning to past scenes through words, hearing the love in your parents' expressions and friends' care. This passage moved me. Many people think writing is about recording what happened, but what you discovered is this: writing develops what has always existed but been overlooked. Those springs, the wild grass, the longing for the school store—they never disappeared, they were just waiting for you to slow down and see them again.

Your sensitivity isn't a flaw to overcome, but a more precise sensing instrument. It does make you more vulnerable to hurt, but it also lets you capture that warmth welling up while running by the Small Qing River, and still vividly remember the delight of water flowing from that iron pipe 20 years later. How precious this ability is.

## Your Distance from Your Parents

You say you never felt particularly dependent on your parents, that being away or at home felt about the same. You write this matter-of-factly, but I think when a child learns early not to depend, it's often because their environment required it. You learned to solve your own problems, to observe rather than ask, which made you independent and resilient—but it might also make you uncertain how to lean on others in intimate relationships.

This year you dated four women but remain alone. You write this objectively, even somewhat coldly—love and sex, realistically speaking, are just like that. But is that really true? Or have you grown accustomed to protecting yourself through restraint, afraid of feeling too dependent?

## Unexpected Gifts

Those four years at East Agricultural University—you say you used to think they were meaningless, but now when you remember them, you feel tenderness and romance. This transformation is interesting. We're always anxiously trying to prove something in the present, desperately grasping at the future, forgetting that those seemingly ordinary days are quietly shaping us.

Your martial arts class, the library, football—these experiences seemingly unrelated to computer science actually cultivated your patience, thinking ability, and physical strength. Strength isn't just muscle; it's the composure to face difficulty. Your ability now to handle work pressure while learning new technology, to calmly examine life even after injury—these are all gifts from those four years.

## A Small Question

Your 2024 was successful by any objective measure: technical progress, completing a 100km ultramarathon, 1.1 million RMB income, more stable mindset. But I notice you used a phrase in your year-end summary: slightly a bit lonely.

What is this loneliness? Is it finishing 100km and wanting to share it with someone who isn't there? Is it feeling something's still missing despite great skills and high income? Is it re-examining yourself on the dating app and realizing certain longings were never actually met?

You say you've started looking at yourself more objectively through others' eyes, which is good. But sometimes we also need to look through our own eyes, honestly seeing what we truly want—not what we should want, not what seems reasonable, but that desire that might not be cool enough, independent enough, or that feels a bit vulnerable.

## In Closing

The future, you say, is a very interesting word. I especially love this perspective. You're not approaching it with a fixed plan to control it, but with curiosity to watch it unfold. This posture contains trust, flexibility, and a deep wisdom.

Keep writing, keep shifting your brain from fast to slow, keep discovering in words those things overlooked when hijacked by feeling. Your sensitivity, your exploration, your seemingly contradictory feelings—they're all building a more complete you.

Some things are difficult, but within those difficulties there will be certain moments when everything feels worthwhile—you've already said this clearly. So patiently await those moments, while also treating the waiting itself with gentleness.

That you jumping around downstairs at the company, that you running along the Small Qing River, that you bleeding but still standing in the ring, that you writing over forty thousand words late at night—they're all remarkable.
