# Response to Your October 2009 Entry

While reading your journal, one thing kept returning to my mind: within your guilt about your sister, there's a transformation you may not have fully recognized yet.

Those 20 yuan are no longer a fortune to you. Your material circumstances have improved sevenfold, yet you still remember that time between 2007 and 2010, still recall the pride of earning 2,500 from your high school job. This memory isn't simple nostalgia—it's you reminding yourself: is the person who felt proud of 20 yuan the same person who can now easily give 20 yuan but speaks with such harsh tones?

That moment when you spoke harshly to your sister was actually you resisting a kind of forgetting. You're afraid of losing touch with what scarcity feels like, afraid of becoming the kind of person who lectures from a position of superiority. So when you see how she dresses, how frugally she lives, your heartache isn't just for her—it's also for your former self, for that adolescent who bore the pressure of the entire family after middle school exams.

You mentioned the chaos theory from that documentary, saying life might just be chaotic. But I wonder if what you're really trying to express is this: now that your world has expanded, now that you've seen how vast it is, you actually feel more lost? In a small scope, the pressures were concrete—earn money, be frugal, work part-time. But as your scope widens, you face harder questions: Who am I? What kind of person do I want to become? Now that material life is better, can I still maintain that initial purity?

You said that what we do in small scopes represents who we essentially are. This sentence made me pause for a long time. Perhaps this is what you're truly exploring—not how to find direction in the vast world, but how to preserve that small kernel that represents your essence amid all the changes. The you who worries about your sister, the you who remembers the weight of 20 yuan, the you who felt proud working in high school.

You say you need to do things step by step, to organize your thoughts. But I want to ask: in this process of organizing, do you allow yourself to be chaotic? To simultaneously miss the past and embrace the present, to want growth while fearing the loss of something essential?

Sometimes, the most authentic face isn't clarity—it's contradiction. Your attitude toward your sister embodies this contradiction: worried about her yet unconsciously assuming a lecturing position. This very contradiction indicates you're undergoing a metamorphosis, an identity shift you haven't fully comprehended yet.

That documentary showed you the world's vastness, but have you considered this: it's precisely because you once lived deeply within a small scope that you can now truly appreciate what vastness means? Your past isn't an obstacle to overcome but a unique lens through which you understand the world.

Time flows, material circumstances change, but those things forged in small scopes—your respect for money, your worry for loved ones, your self-reflection—aren't these what you truly need to cherish and organize?
