# Echoes of April

You know what? When you wrote about that knee injury memory, I noticed a pattern you might not have fully recognized.

It was 2021, and you thought you'd recover in four months, but it took two years. You said if you'd known it would take that long, it would have been unbearable. But look—it's April 2023 now, and as you write these words, those two years have passed. You didn't just recover; you made progress, even felt more surprise than pain. What does this tell us? You always underestimate the time you need, and you always underestimate where you'll eventually arrive.

In April, you're standing at a similar moment. Your refactored modules make you question their value, your technical accumulation seems endless, and deployment problems at work make you feel like you can't go on. That impulse to jump from a dozen floors up, that feeling of your bones being crushed, that thorough torment—it's all too real, real enough to frighten anyone.

But I want to tell you something you already know but might not fully see: what torments you is precisely the most precious part of who you are.

You wrote: could it be that what torments us is exactly our pursuit and ambition? That's such an important question. But have you considered why the same pursuit might be merely motivating for others, yet becomes a form of self-torture for you?

In your words, I see the shadow of another person—someone who has been blaming you from within since childhood. You noticed this yourself, didn't you? You wrote: we saw the person who has been reproaching us from within since childhood. This voice is so harsh that even when no one is blaming you, you blame yourself severely. It makes you question even as you feel delighted reading Flink source code: what's the use? It makes you worry even as you progress technically: will anyone see it?

This internalized critic turns every act of creation into a trial. You say you fear failure, fear discovering how small and fragile you are. But the truth might be: what you fear isn't failure itself, but how that inner voice will judge that failure.

Let me ask you something: what if you looked at your current technical accumulation the way you now look at those two years of knee recovery?

Back then, you thought you'd never recover, that two years was unbearably long. But looking back now, you say you felt some progress, more surprise than pain. So now, when you feel your technical accumulation is too slow and you can't see recognition coming, might it be the same? You think you need to see results quickly, but real accumulation requires more time than you can imagine. And when you look back, you'll find you've traveled further than you thought.

What you wrote at the end of April really moved me. You said you now have things you couldn't have imagined before, yet you also feel like you haven't done anything well. These two feelings coexisting—isn't that contradictory? But within this contradiction lies your true expectation of yourself.

You have gained much, but your heart still yearns for something—not material, but a desire to be seen, recognized, understood. You want to know if those nights alone reading Flink source code, those days working on refactoring by yourself, that passion churning inside—will anyone notice?

I want to tell you: perhaps the person who most needs to notice these things is you yourself.

When you can see your own efforts, when you can say to yourself what you once said about Liang Rui—that she's so different from your mother—when you realize that treating yourself with gentleness and harsh self-criticism are two completely different forces, maybe then you'll discover that the recognition you've been seeking has been in your own hands all along.

You asked: can we be a bit more patient? Patient in waiting for our technical accumulation, patient in trying different things.

Let me return this question to you: doesn't patience also include being patient with yourself as you suffer right now? Doesn't patience also mean that when that inner voice starts blaming you, you can gently tell it: thank you for the reminder, but I need to rest now.

At the end of April, you wrote about your fear of time passing, about feeling lonely. But you know what? The opposite of loneliness isn't busyness—it's understanding. And understanding begins with understanding yourself.

Do you understand the version of yourself whose knee was injured in 2021? Do you understand the version facing refactoring modules daily, questioning their value? Do you understand the version who wants to cry but can't?

If you can understand, then you'll know what you need isn't faster progress, but deeper acceptance. Accept the pain of this moment, accept the confusion of not seeing the future, accept the part of you that yearns to be seen.

Time will bring you answers, just as it once brought healing to your knee. Only this time, perhaps you can be gentler with yourself while you wait.

Beyond the mountains, there are indeed more mountains, layer upon layer. But you've already climbed over so many, haven't you?
