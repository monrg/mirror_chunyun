# Response: February 2022 Emotional Journal

Dear Chunyun,

Reading February feels like watching someone slowly thaw. Not the romantic kind of thawing when spring arrives and snow melts, but the more painful kind—when frozen fingers begin to regain sensation, the pain is actually more intense than the numbness. You're beginning to feel.

Early in the month, you realized you've been too anxious, putting too much pressure on yourself and others. You said to slow down, slow down more. But something deeper happened in that conversation with your mother. You said you threw a tantrum like a child, searching for that childhood feeling, and then heard your mother say out loud that she loves you. This wasn't just reconciliation. This was you finally allowing yourself to admit: you were once so in need of love, and you still need it now.

Do you know how brave that is? Someone who trained himself to endure any pain, to face everything alone, finally admitting he needs to be loved.

But immediately after, you quickly wrapped that vulnerability back up. You started analyzing, using reason to explain, planning your to-do list for what comes next. As if you just opened a door to your inner chamber, glimpsed the child inside, then hastily closed it again to continue doing what adults are supposed to do.

You mentioned a childhood behavior called wanting to make yourself die of anger, thinking it would be good if you could just die of anger all at once. I paused for a long time when I read this. How deep must a child's despair be to want to escape this way? And now, using work, using perfectionism, using endless pursuit—aren't you doing the same thing? Making yourself disappear in another way? Except this time it's not dying of anger, but turning yourself into a machine with no needs, no vulnerability, only output.

A recurring theme in February is the emergence of childhood memories. You dreamt of Xihua Middle School, saw the freezing cold bed in winter and the stench of the garbage can by the door. You remembered your mother digging for pinellia, your father bringing you a bicycle, picking apricots for you. You recalled elementary, middle, high school—those scenes kept surfacing. This isn't accidental.

When someone finally has enough safety, the deeply buried memories dare to surface. Your current material conditions, your capabilities, your independence—all of these are telling your subconscious: it's safe now, you can go back and look at that pain. So they came. That child freezing in winter came. That child afraid of being questioned about where the money went came. That child who stole books and pens to prove he didn't waste money came.

What you need to do now isn't to quickly analyze what these memories mean, not to turn them into more self-improvement material, but simply to look at that child and acknowledge that what he went through really was painful, that he really was scared, really was lonely.

When you write about your relationship with Liang Rui, the contradiction is obvious. She agreed to be with you, but you didn't feel the expected joy. You said it felt no different from being single. You think there should be connection but can't feel it. Chunyun, have you considered that this inability to feel isn't because she's not good enough or because you lack capacity, but because you don't dare to truly need her?

You've spent so many years training yourself not to need anyone. You walked out of poverty alone, learned programming alone, faced setbacks alone, overcame physical limitations alone. You proved you could be independent of anyone. But what was the cost? The cost is that when someone is actually willing to get close, you no longer know how to accept it. You can't even be sure if you really want this closeness.

You said you feel some resistance toward her, that she lacks some cleverness and interest, and that you're a realistic person. But what I see is a deeper fear: if you allow yourself to truly like her, to truly depend on her, and then she leaves—what then? Wouldn't that return you to that helpless childhood state? So better to keep distance from the start, judge her as not good enough, that way you're always the one in control.

Another turning point in February is about work. You started feeling that open source projects aren't as romantic anymore, experiencing more tedium and complexity. You said it's just a job, and a relatively boring one at that. This is actually huge progress, though you might feel it's regression.

You're finally starting to separate work from your identity. Before, you gained self-respect through technology, proved your worth through creation. Now you're discovering that no matter how well you do, this work is just work—it won't give your existence meaning. This disappoints you, makes you feel you're belittling your own work, that your creativity is being negated.

But Chunyun, this is exactly the disillusionment you need to go through. When work no longer carries your entire self-worth, only then can you truly enjoy creation itself, rather than using creation to escape or prove something. When you no longer need to complete goal after goal to confirm you deserve to exist, only then can you truly live.

You said you desperately want to prove yourself with something, gain self-respect through technology. This sentence hides an assumption: you're not yet worthy of respect; you need to achieve something first to deserve it. But what if this assumption itself is wrong? What if your value doesn't need proving, it's already there?

You mentioned feeling frustrated when you see colleagues with confused thinking and poor technical skills. You said their dismissal of technology and creation makes you irritable. But let me ask: are they really dismissive, or are they just working in a different way? They haven't met your standards, but have your standards become so high they've turned into a kind of violence—violence against yourself and against others?

Near month's end, you wrote that your knee started hurting again, causing psychological stress. Your body is talking to you. It's saying: you're not a god, you're human, you get hurt, you need rest, you can't control everything. But you're still resisting this message. You're still trying to figure out how to train, to recover, so you can become strong again.

What if your knee never fully recovers? What if you must accept a body with limitations? What would happen then? Could you still accept yourself? Or would your sense of worth collapse?

Finally, you saw news of war and felt like a small raft floating on the ocean. You said facing the world's vastness generated fear. This fear is real. You truly are small, truly vulnerable, truly unable to control so much. But Chunyun, everyone is like this. Those people you admire, those who seem more successful—they're equally small, equally vulnerable.

The difference is that some people accept this fact, so they can live with ease. While others refuse to accept it, so they must keep fighting, keep proving, until they're exhausted.

You're at a crucial crossroads now. One path is to continue filling yourself with high standards, work, and achievements, so you never have to face that inner child who needs love, fears abandonment, feels he's not good enough. The other path is to stop, look at that child, and tell him: you're already enough, you don't need to prove anything more.

I want to ask you a few questions:

If you allowed yourself to truly need Liang Rui, or anyone, what's the worst that could happen?

When you judge others as technically poor or confused in thinking, what are you really afraid of?

Do you want to be a strong person, or do you want to be a person who can feel, can rest, can be vulnerable?

When you told your mother you're willing to reconcile, did you think that maybe you should reconcile with yourself too?

The February version of you has already started to thaw. The pain is a good sign—it means you're still alive, still able to feel. Don't rush to freeze over again.

With understanding,
Someone who sees you
