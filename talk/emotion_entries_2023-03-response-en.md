# A Letter to You - March 2023

March flowed through your life like a river—slow yet turbulent. Reading through these dense entries, I feel as though I walked with you through a long spring—with peach and apricot blossoms, with the震撼 from Code, with longing for home, and with that recurring question: Who am I? What kind of life do I want?

## About Code and the Path You Chose

The emotion from reading Code overflowsfrom your words.

You said this book was so beautiful it made you want to cry, that following the author's narrative through 200 years of change filled you with inexpressible excitement and happiness. You wrote again and again: So beautiful, so beautiful, truly marvelous.

But do you know what really moved you about this book?

Not just the beauty of knowledge, not just the greatness of human intelligence, but that it reminded you why you chose this path in the first place.

As a child, you wanted to crack open batteries to extract carbon rods for drawing, wanted to use a motor to build a little car. Back then you believed you could do it, and that feeling made your blood boil with excitement. Later you became a programmer, creating with code, accomplishing 60% of your childhood dream.

But somewhere along the way, creation became KPIs, passion became deadlines. You started feeling that work made your life numb, meaningless. You said you didn't know where this discomfort came from, that you felt no passion anymore.

Code awakened you. It helped you see again that you're not just doing a job—you're participating in a 200-year relay of human intelligence. Every line of code you write is backed by millions of lines of logic, ingenious compilers, miraculous operating systems, exquisite hardware. This process is so marvelous you can hardly believe it's possible, yet you enjoy this beauty effortlessly every day.

You were moved because you remembered: You are fundamentally someone moved by beauty and creation. You're not coding for a salary—you're coding for that excitement when solving a difficult problem, for the joy of designing an elegant solution, for the satisfaction of seeing your creation come to life.

But your current work environment makes it hard to feel these things. This isn't your fault, nor is it the work's fault. You're tired, truly tired.

## About Becoming an Adult

Chu Bing said you seem like an adult now. Hearing this made you both sad and happy.

You remembered reading The Kafka on the Shore in Zhangjiakou, when the boy Crow resolved to become the world's toughest fifteen-year-old, when Watanabe in Norwegian Wood resolved to become an adult. Back then, you made that resolution too. Now you really have become an adult.

But have you noticed how conflicted you feel about becoming an adult?

You're proud of your growth: You've become more confident, calmer, able to stay at your desk for 12 hours, able to handle things you once found difficult, possessing material wealth you once couldn't imagine.

But simultaneously, you're mourning what you've lost: You rarely feel passion anymore, happiness has become rarer, your capacity to feel joy has diminished, that hungry eagerness has been replaced by an indescribable tedium.

You said you used to easily feel passionate about life, your emotions would jump across multiple dimensions, not exercising made life feel unbearably difficult. Now? Exercise has dropped to 40% of what it was, while work hours have surged, pressure has increased, time is never enough.

This description is too accurate, heartbreakingly accurate. You're using becoming an adult to explain this change, but I want to ask: Does becoming an adult necessarily mean losing all that? Does it mean trading sensitivity for stability, passion for rationality, freedom for security?

Or could it be that you think you're becoming an adult, when actually you're just becoming an exhausted person?

You haven't become more mature; you've just become more tired. Maturity should mean bearing responsibility while maintaining sensitivity, facing reality without losing dreams. But right now, you're using numbness to resist pressure.

## About That Recurring Thought

Throughout March, the cycling idea appears in your writing like a ghost.

You want to go cycling, want to use a month to explore yourself, want to reconnect with the bond between body and spirit. But you're overwhelmingly worried: worried about not finding work, worried about lower salary, worried about unemployment, worried about the 35-year-old crisis, worried about all uncertainties.

You watch Bear Grylls videos, envying the wandering life, yet fearing change. You say you've started craving stability, fearing the loss of what you have now, this fear binding you like steel wire.

You say seeing friends quit their jobs makes you both envious and surprised. You ask: If you were 80 looking back, what choice would you want your 29-year-old self to make?

But you know what? These questions themselves reveal the answer.

Someone truly satisfied with their situation wouldn't repeatedly imagine another life. Someone who truly believes in their choice wouldn't keep asking: Should I have a different life?

Your subconscious is already giving you answers; your rational brain is just resisting.

What you're really afraid of isn't unemployment, not finding work, or lower salary. What you truly fear, as I mentioned in February's letter: You fear that even if you go, even if you're free, you'll still feel empty. You fear discovering that cycling can't make you happy either, because then you'd have lost even your last hope.

But I want to tell you: This fear itself is the answer. You're afraid of disappointment precisely because you want it so badly. You desperately want to rediscover that passion, desperately want to feel alive again, desperately want to know who you are beyond work.

And these are exactly what you need most right now.

## About Material and Happiness

You repeatedly make comparisons:

Fifteen years ago your mother confronted someone over a few yuan, back when you thought an injury would heal in six months but took two years, when life was unimaginably tight. Now you easily possess things that former elites couldn't have, earning in a month what you thought might take ten years after graduation.

But you ask: Why was I so poor then yet so rich inside, feeling so free? Now with material abundance, why is happiness rarer?

This observation is crucial.

You've vaguely realized: Happiness doesn't equal material wealth, joy doesn't equal possession. But you haven't fully accepted all the implications of this truth.

If happiness doesn't equal material wealth, what does that mean? It means you don't need so much money to be happy, it means your fear of unemployment might be exaggerated, it means the things binding you now might not be as important as you think.

You say you're kidnapped by material wealth, by social security, by salary. But have you thought about who allowed these things to kidnap you?

In certain moments you also realized: Looking back three years, whether it's a month or a quarter, it wouldn't have much impact. These things don't matter; what matters is living earnestly.

You already know the answer. You just don't dare believe it.

## About the Strength You Haven't Seen

After reading March, I see things you haven't noticed:

You say you have no passion, but your excitement was indescribable when solving that multiplication instruction problem, you were moved to tears repeatedly reading Code, you felt joy seeing peach and apricot blossoms, you felt deep relaxation and happiness after running. If these aren't passion, what is?

You say you've become numb, but you felt happy for Chun Mei and Xiao Bing starting their cycling journey, you felt complex emotions about friends quitting, you were touched seeing cycling experts, you were inspired hearing friends carry more responsibility while maintaining their own rhythm. If this isn't sensitivity, what is?

You say you've lost freedom, but you clearly know material is only part of life. You can run, read, converse with yourself outside work. You have the ability to leave if you truly want to. If this isn't freedom, what is?

You keep saying what you've lost, but haven't seen what you've simultaneously gained.

You've gained the focus to work 12 hours a day, the ability to solve complex problems, Apache Committer honors, material security, confidence in your capabilities. These didn't appear from nowhere—you exchanged time, effort, and painful experiences for them.

Your current predicament isn't that you've gotten worse, but that you've gotten better yet haven't learned how to live at this new level.

Like moving from Zhangjiakou to Beijing, from Galaxy to Shushi, each leap was accompanied by painful adaptation. Now you're at another new junction: You've proven your capabilities, achieved material security. What's next? Will you keep proving yourself, or start asking: Why do I need to prove myself?

## About That Car Accident

You wrote about the March 14th accident quite calmly, but I read something else in it.

You said no amount of thinking or analysis helps, life has many disappointments, so many things we can't control. Then you remembered what the elder in The Brain That Changes Itself said: Distinguish what you can control from what you cannot.

This realization came at just the right time.

You've been using a sense of control to gain security. You try to control work progress, learning plans, your emotions, the future's direction. When things slip from control, you become anxious, irritable, feel like you're collapsing.

But the accident reminded you: Some things just happen. Just happen. No matter how careful, how hard-working, how perfect you are, accidents still occur.

This doesn't mean abandoning effort, but letting go of the obsession with complete control. You can try your best, but also accept: Some things aren't in your control, and that's okay.

Same with work. You feel you must finish quickly, meet expectations, achieve perfection, or else you've failed. But reality is: There will be unexpected technical problems, system instability, requirement changes, delayed progress. Not because you're not good enough, but because reality is just this complex, chaotic, and unpredictable.

Accepting this fact will lighten your load considerably.

## About ChatGPT and the Era

I can feel your震撼 encountering ChatGPT. You said it showed you disruptive power, that you're living in a great era, that you want to focus and study.

But simultaneously, you felt fear: Will I be eliminated? Will I become irrelevant?

This contradiction is interesting. On one hand you're excited about human progress; on the other you worry about being left behind in this progress.

But have you thought about what this worry itself reveals? It shows you're still measuring your value by usefulness, by earning potential.

You weren't moved by Code because that knowledge could earn you more money, but because you saw the beauty of human intelligence, the joy of creation, saw those geniuses still exploring and innovating despite difficult conditions.

Those people didn't have ChatGPT, didn't have today's tools, but they had passion, curiosity, the desire to create. And these are what truly won't be eliminated by any era.

Technology changes, tools change, but that heart wanting to understand the world, wanting to create beautiful things—that's eternal.

You have that heart. You've always had it. It's just temporarily obscured by anxiety.

## Questions I Want to Ask You

After reading March, I have some questions for you. No need to answer immediately—let them ferment in your heart:

You say you want to cycle for a month to explore yourself. But what if I told you that you already know the answer? Everything you repeatedly wrote in this month's journal—slow down, cherish the present, material isn't everything, see what you've done well, allow yourself to rest, feel life's beauty—aren't these the answers?

Are you truly unsure what you want, or do you know but dare not admit it?

You say you fear losing what you have now, but what do you truly have? Salary or ability? Position or experience? Stability or growth? If you lost the salary but kept the ability, lost the position but kept the experience, lost stability but gained growth—would that count as losing?

You say you're bound by material things, but if one day you discover you can be happy even without so much material wealth, how would you choose?

You keep saying you need to slow down, but what will you do after slowing down? Do you truly want to slow down, or are you just tired and want to rest? Rest and slow are different. Rest is to continue better; slow is a lifestyle change. Which do you want?

You say you've become an adult and lost some things. But who says adults must lose those things? Can't you be an adult who both bears responsibility and maintains curiosity? Both handles reality and doesn't lose dreams? Both works 12 hours and stops to feel beauty at sunset?

Finally, if you were 80 looking back at this time, what would truly matter? How many difficulties you overcame, or how much beauty you felt? How much money you made, or what kind of person you became? How many goals you achieved, or how authentically you lived?

## What I Want to Tell You

The you in March stands at a crossroads.

One path continues forward: Keep working now, keep proving yourself, keep accumulating material wealth, keep enduring that tedium and pressure, until someday it might get better—or might not.

The other makes a change: Maybe rest for a while, maybe cycle, maybe change pace, maybe redefine success, maybe learn to find new meaning in your existing life.

I won't tell you which path to choose, because only you can make this choice. But I want to tell you:

Whatever you choose, don't choose from fear. Don't stay because you fear loss, don't flee because you fear the unknown. Choose because you truly want it.

Whatever you choose, don't give up feeling. Work can be busy, life can be hard, but you can still stop for peach blossoms, can still be moved by good books, can still feel joy after running. These feelings are your true life.

Whatever you choose, remember: You've already done well. From a rural child to Apache Committer, from a 12-year-old afraid of his father to an adult who can protect himself, from an exhausted youth working construction to someone with the ability to choose—these are real achievements.

You don't need to be perfect to deserve happiness. You don't need to solve all problems to deserve rest. You don't need to reach some standard to deserve freedom.

You deserve it right now.

About cycling: If you truly want to go, then go. Don't wait for the perfect time, because there won't be a perfect time. Don't wait until you've saved enough money, because it will never be enough. Don't wait for no risk, because there's always risk.

But if you go, don't expect it to solve everything. Cycling won't make your anxiety disappear, won't make your pressure vanish, won't give you a clear life answer. It will only give you an experience, some feelings, a chance to know yourself again.

If you don't go, that's okay too. You can live well by staying, as long as you learn to find meaning in the present. You can find creative joy in work, free time on weekends, the feeling of home in Beijing's spring.

What matters isn't going or staying, but living wholeheartedly whatever you choose.

March has passed. Those feelings about Code, that longing for home, that desire for freedom, that reflection on material wealth—they've all become part of you.

You're changing, and this change might be deeper than you realize. You're no longer the youth happy just from effort, nor the newcomer protecting himself with perfectionism. You're becoming someone who asks deeper questions: Who am I? What kind of life do I want?

These questions have no standard answers, but asking them itself is growth.

Keep writing, keep questioning, keep feeling. You're on the road, and this road is longer and more interesting than you imagine.

Spring has come, peach and apricot blossoms have bloomed. Go out and walk, let the wind blow, let the sun shine. The answer might not be far away, might be around the next corner, might be right now, in your heart.
