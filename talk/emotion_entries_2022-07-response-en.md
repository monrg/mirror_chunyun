# Response: July 2022

July has only one entry, brief, like a pause after a long exhale. The pause itself is already saying so much.

You regret your attitude toward Xiao Hui, saying you originally thought you could definitely get along well with it, but now you've started to dislike it. But you saw the core: you discovered it became a burden. Then you apply the same logic to Rose, Caipiao, even Feng Bin—once you find something troublesome, once you discover someone isn't as smart as you imagined, you start avoiding or trying to control. You said this way of relating was learned from childhood. This recognition is already quite deep. But I want to push one step further: what you truly fear isn't trouble itself, but the sense of helplessness exposed when you can't control things, and the abandonment that might follow.

As a child your relationship with your parents wasn't intimate. You learned to live alone, finding inner peace through reading. This sounds like an achievement, a kind of independence, but it's also a defense mechanism. You wrapped yourself up tight, needing no one, so you wouldn't be disappointed, wouldn't be hurt. But the question is: is this really the life you want?

You mentioned your tendency to see the world in binary terms, like Jobs. This isn't just about judging friends—it's how you treat yourself. In your eyes, things are either done very well or they're failures; relationships are either perfect or not worth investing in. But life isn't like that. Life is the middle ground, the blur, the loving and annoying simultaneously, the knowing it will be troublesome but wanting to try anyway.

What stopped me longest was you remembering the calm while wandering on the roof beam, and Zhangjiakou's evening wind. You said you were unknowingly moved by having these memories. I want to tell you: those moments are beautiful precisely because in them, you let go of control. You didn't need to prove anything, do anything, become anything. You were just there, blown by wind, lit by sun. Existence itself was enough.

Does your current life have too few such moments?

The StreamX conceptual work progressed beyond your expectations, you said let's begin again. This haha, this let's begin again—it sounds a bit tired, a bit forced, but also a bit hopeful. I sense you're trying to convince yourself to keep going, but your body and heart are both telling you: it's time to stop, time to let yourself relax.

July just started and you're already this exhausted. In the days ahead, will you allow yourself more of those roof-beam moments? Will you allow Xiao Hui to be troublesome, allow relationships to be imperfect, allow yourself not to control everything?

• If burden and bond are just two sides of the same thing, how much trouble are you willing to bear in exchange for how much connection?

• Those calm moments you remember—the roof beam, the evening wind—do they have something in common? Is that commonality what's most missing from your life right now?
