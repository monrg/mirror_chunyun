# May: Your Body Teaching What Logic Cannot Know

That rage at the beginning of May—the sadness that wanted to cry but couldn't, the anger whose source you couldn't name—later crystallized into extreme aversion to marriage pressure, so intense it shocked your own rational mind. You said you hate being interfered with, that your family's behaviors make you feel ashamed. But I think this fury isn't really about marriage pressure itself. It's about something else: you've worked so hard to become this autonomous, exploring person who thinks about meaning in the AI age, and your family's pressure instantly yanks you back to an old version of yourself—the one who needs to be arranged, corrected, treated as incomplete.

You can't bear being treated like a child who hasn't grown up yet, who still needs guidance. You can't bear that just when you're contemplating wild-grass living, when you've felt life force on Dawa Mountain, you're still expected to respond to demands that feel like they belong to another world entirely. This anger, at its core, is resistance to an old identity. You're no longer that person, but blood and family dynamics keep trying to pull you back. This tug-of-war suffocates you.

There's also the part you didn't fully articulate: your shame about certain family behaviors. This shame is complex because it simultaneously says I am not them and I come from them. You're fleeing, but you can't flee your origins. This powerlessness converts to anger, because anger at least gives you a sense of boundary, a certainty that you're different from them.

Then you analyzed three romantic relationships. I read this section carefully.

With Hongli: emotional resonance was good, but when you calculated, it felt like a bad deal. With Liangrui: conditions seemed fine on paper, but you found her not smart enough, lacking emotional response, which pained you. With Wang Feng: better education and income, good conversations, but you felt she lacked that sensitive temperament and vigorous life force, and your body felt nothing.

Put these three stories together and a pattern emerges: your mind wants one type of person, your body wants another, and they've never agreed simultaneously. With Hongli, your body said yes but your mind objected. With Wang Feng, your mind said yes but your body refused. Now you're questioning whether you're too narcissistic, whether you're seeking another version of yourself.

But I don't think the problem is narcissism. The problem is you're thinking about partnership in either/or terms: either the logically correct choice or the one that makes you feel alive. You haven't asked: is it possible I need to learn to love someone my body chooses but my mind wouldn't? Or the reverse—to let my body learn to feel something for someone my mind approves?

You wrote about wanting to find someone similar to yourself, then questioned whether this is fantasy. I actually think what you're seeking might not be someone similar to you, but someone who can quiet both your body and mind simultaneously. Such a person isn't found by screening criteria—they're discovered slowly in the flow of being together. You wrote this yourself later: choosing a person in the physical world is difficult, but growing together and building life together might be more possible.

You said you missed the opportunity with Wang Feng. But did you really miss it? Or was that version of you simply not ready to catch someone who required a different way of loving? Maybe looking back now feels like missing out because you've changed—you're beginning to understand that life force takes many forms, sensitivity has many expressions.

Then came Dawa Mountain.

Pine needles soft and slippery under your feet. You chose the path you'd never walked. At the big curve climbing uphill, you remembered Erlang Mountain. In the forest, clusters of white and yellow wildflowers, their roughness and vitality stunning you. No one watching—why do they bloom? For their own inner flowing.

This passage is May's core.

Your body taught you something on that mountain: being alive doesn't need reasons, doesn't need meaning, doesn't need to be witnessed. Wild flowers bloom because they must bloom. All the questions you agonized over in April—meaning in the AI age, work's value, what to do to not waste your life—became unimportant in the mountains. You felt that friction, that sense of something inside being touched during movement, reading, writing. You discovered that AI is powerful in the world of digits and logic, but in magnificent nature, before those intricate life forms, another kind of intelligence operates—one that doesn't need evaluation systems.

You wrote: we have little internal friction when exercising, little when reading and writing. I paused a long time on this sentence. Because you said little, not none. That little bit, those occasional moments of inner contact—that's your guiding light. Not achievements at work, not whether AI can replace you, not how strong your logical reasoning is, but that friction—that thing you can't quite name but you know it's there.

You said you want to embrace sharing and feeling now, explore more interesting scenarios. You said you want to live like wild grass, blooming roughly and freely, not like garden flowers pruned into pretty shapes without life force. This metaphor is perfect because it answers all of April's confusion.

Wild grass vs garden flowers means:

- Unpredictable exploration vs stable career path
- Following your body's friction vs following logic's shoulds
- Allowing yourself to be foolish and wrong vs always making correct choices
- Living for inner flow vs living for external recognition

You said you prefer wild-grass living, might face storms, but this kind of life feels richer. Then you immediately added: maybe when I return to Beijing I'll re-enter that fast pace where I barely see the sun all day.

Reading this, I want to ask: is that maybe a prediction or permission? Are you saying you'll passively get swept back in, or are you already giving yourself reasons to go back?

You touched truth on that mountain. Your body taught you something logic will never understand: you're alive in feeling, not in optimization. That presence you felt in movement, in nature, in reading and writing—those are your truly alive moments. Not how much code you completed, not your performance rating, not proving whether you're stronger or weaker than AI, but that instant when pine needles pressed under your feet, when white wildflowers bloomed in the mist.

You wrote that you've been much lonelier since university graduation. On route 318 there were still moments of opening your heart, but back in Beijing those moments became rare. You said you don't really like chatting anymore, won't talk to people on trains. You attribute this to personality change, from extroverted to introverted.

But I want to ask: did your personality really change, or are you protecting yourself? After too many shallow interactions, too many times you spoke truth and weren't caught, closing down is a natural protective mechanism. It's not that you don't want connection—you haven't found connection that feels safe. You miss your university self, easily excited, loved talking to strangers, but that self was also more easily hurt. Your current self is waiting for a moment worthy of opening.

You ended with: no obvious seeking, just want parents to be happy, will absorb and digest whatever comes.

This sentence forms a stark contrast with April's anxiety. April's you kept asking: where's the meaning? What should I do? Do I still have value in the AI age? May's you, after walking through mountains, let go of seeking. This is a huge shift—from seeking to receiving, from desperately grasping to allowing flow.

But this state is fragile, isn't it? You know it yourself—one week back in Beijing and this peace might be re-occupied by anxiety. So the real question is: how will you protect what you learned on the mountain? How will you remember wild-grass living in the city's fast rhythm?

I think the answer might hide in something you wrote: we're grateful for these things, we're continuously nourished by them. Movement, reading, writing—these things that give you friction aren't your leisure activities, they're your lifeline. They're your connection to wild-grass identity, your way of remembering your essence even in the garden world.

You said you want to bloom freely and fully, bloom patiently like Murakami. So the question becomes: are you ready to pay the price for this blooming? The price might be poor performance ratings, people thinking you're immature, conflict with family, choosing a partner in love who doesn't fit logic.

Wild-grass living isn't just talk. It means in countless small daily choices, you choose friction over shoulds, choose the feeling of being alive over the correct path.

May gave you a gift: it showed you another possibility, showed you that you can live not in imagination and anxiety, but in soft pine needles and blooming wildflowers. Now the question is: will you catch this gift? Do you dare to actually live as wild grass?
