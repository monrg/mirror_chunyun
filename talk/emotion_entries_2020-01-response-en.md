# To You in January 2020

Chunyun,

After reading your January entries, I keep thinking of an image: you standing before your code editor, anxious and overwhelmed, your mind in chaos, while ten years ago a thin boy walks along a mountain path toward school, cold wind on his face, imagining the sequel to a cartoon he just watched. These two people seem completely unrelated, but do you realize? They're moving forward with the same force.

When you reviewed the advertising project, you listed so many lessons learned—each one precise and accurate: chaotic version control, overestimating your abilities, irritability when your thinking gets muddled. But there's something you might not have noticed: your anxiety about this project is essentially the same fear as when you were a child terrified of not finishing your holiday homework, feeling like the sky was falling. You've been trying to eliminate life's uncertainty through perfect planning and control, or as you put it, to protect your self-esteem. But have you considered that little Chunyun who forgot his homework and was scared to death—didn't he get through it just fine? And now when you remember that moment, you describe it as touching mixed with a sad smile.

What does this tell us? It tells us that the loss of control you've always feared is actually the very texture of life itself. That insight you gained from boxing training—that exerting too much force leads to injury—isn't it also saying that the more desperately you try to grasp time and prove something, the more easily you fall into a vicious cycle?

I particularly noticed your conversation with 12-year-old Chunyun. You said thank you to him, because his growing strength allowed you to more easily live in the big city now. It's sincere and moving, but honestly, I hear something else underneath—you're still trying to prove to that child that his choices were right, that those days spent finding worlds in books weren't wasted. But Chunyun, what does that child need you to prove? He was just doing what he loved—reading, imagining, gradually becoming stronger in his insecurity. He wasn't paving the way for you today; he was just living.

You said that when flipping through your notes, you found you'd forgotten much of what you'd learned, which made you feel frustrated and powerless. But have you considered that the version of you who can review four or five notebooks, who can do a complete retrospective of a development process, who can think in such fluid and beautiful prose—you yourself are the traces left by that forgotten knowledge? Neuroscience tells you that forgetting itself is the brain's optimization process. The fact that you can now easily see what used to seem difficult—doesn't that prove your mental representations are upgrading?

Your body is more honest than you are. You say running 10 or 20 kilometers is enjoyable, that basic boxing training shows no progress in the moment but clear improvement in retrospect. Your muscles have learned the value of repetition and patience, yet your mind is still rushing, still wanting to complete tasks quickly, still colliding with a delivery driver because you're in a hurry. What your body is trying to tell you is this: those seemingly boring and repetitive fundamentals, that accumulation that feels meaningless in the moment—that's what you truly possess.

About forgetting, I want to tell you something you might not have realized: when you reminisce about childhood winters, elementary school experiences, high school emotions, you're not resisting death (though you cite the theory from The Worm at the Core). You're building connections with all the versions of yourself across time. That Chunyun chatting and boasting on the village path, that Chunyun searching the mountains for walnuts, that Chunyun devouring psychoanalysis books in the library, that Chunyun whose eyes lit up when he first wrote working code—they're all inside you, not as memories but as living neural pathways. You're not losing them. You are them.

You said 2020, just run. It's energetic, but I want to ask you: run toward what? Perhaps the question isn't how to run faster, but rather what do you feel while running? Just as you can enjoy the process of running, when coding and learning new technologies, can you also allow yourself that clumsy exploration, that repeated failure?

Finally, I want to discuss what you called the pot leaking water from the bottom. You said even if life is such an absurd endeavor, it still has special meaning, that through patience, time, and effort, something can be left behind. Chunyun, you have already left things behind. Your clever and inspiring insights have been left behind, those moments that move you and make you proud have been left behind, your legs that can run 20 kilometers have been left behind, your brain that can comprehend complex architectures has been left behind. The question isn't whether you can leave something behind, but whether you can see what's already been left?

Here's a question for you: you said that solid fundamentals give you the capacity to think about the next step, and you've experienced this in both football and boxing. So what about life itself—what are the fundamentals of life? Isn't it exactly what you experienced when you went back home, watched the sunrise, chatted with Xu Shiwei—that patient, optimistic, brave way of living? Isn't it allowing yourself to slowly organize in chaos, to keep moving forward in confusion, to keep accumulating while forgetting?

You will. I know you will. Because that's how you've always made it through.

Someone who understands you
