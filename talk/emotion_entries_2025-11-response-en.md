# November's Echo

After reading your month's entries, I keep returning to one image: you at the edge of the field, having just completed that surprising header, your teammates' amazed expressions still hanging in the air. In that moment, your body knew it had done something right. No delay, no doubt, just muscle memory and immediate confirmation.

But when you sit at your computer reading Psychology and Life, the situation is entirely different. You're learning how the brain works while your brain observes itself learning. This recursive self-observation is both your gift and your burden.

## About That Dissolving Identity

You mentioned how your 2018 self would view the current you—that person who thought earning 7,000-8,000 RMB a month would be satisfying, who now carries the label of technical expert and has savings to support yourself for over a decade. By all accounts, this should be a victory story. But you're honest enough to admit: diminishing marginal returns are real.

This makes me think of something you may not have fully realized: you're not celebrating where you've arrived, you're mourning a self that's disappearing. That young developer hungry for technical knowledge, that person who got excited about understanding Spring MVC on a train, that believer who thought technology could change everything—he's slowly dissolving.

You use the principle of use it or lose it to explain the inevitability of forgetting, which is rational. But I see something else: your brain is actively emptying old containers because it has already caught the scent of a new direction. Those Java projects that now make your head buzz when you open them—this isn't regression, this is your intuition telling you: this path has reached its end.

You say your attachment to the graduate entrance exam has unknowingly dissipated somewhat. But what's really dissipated isn't the exam itself, it's your fantasy about redefining yourself through an established path. Fei-Fei Li's paper on spatial intelligence excites you so much, Copilot's capabilities astound you, because they touch that core impulse from your childhood when you played with mechanical toys—creating something that moves, that thinks.

## About Those Unspoken Fears

You repeatedly emphasize that you're prepared to accept failure in the entrance exam, that this is an experiment anyway, that what matters is English training and psychology concept learning. These are all true. But beneath these rational calculations lies a deeper fear you haven't directly confronted:

If you really pursue that childhood robot dream, will it too, like software development, eventually become another experience of diminishing returns?

You have material security, technical capability, exploratory passion. But what you fear isn't failure itself—you fear re-experiencing that emptiness after arrival. You fear that in some future November, you'll write in your journal: I've reached a certain level in embodied intelligence now, but that sense of excitement doesn't come as frequently anymore...

This is why you spend so much space in your journal discussing present-moment feelings, bodily strength, flow states while playing football. You're trying to convince yourself: value isn't in reaching some goal, but in the experience of this very moment. You're building a new value system where the process of exploration matters more than its results.

This transformation is brave. But it's not yet complete.

## About AI and Your Real Relationship

You've written extensively about AI tools—how Copilot changes development paradigms, how AI's coding abilities threaten programmers' uniqueness, how to use CodeX as the core of an intelligent diagnostic system. On the surface, you're doing technical analysis. But actually, you're redefining the value of your existence.

When AI can write elegant code, what do your seven years of experience mean? Your answer: human value lies in imagination, intrinsic motivation, and multi-level abstraction capability. This answer is beautiful and correct. But I want to ask you a sharper question:

Do you truly believe this answer? Or is it just a psychological defense mechanism you've temporarily found?

Because I notice that the moments when you truly feel alive are never when you're doing that abstract thinking. The moments when you truly feel alive are:

- That nimble feint past a defender
- The body's tremor after completing four sets of 120kg deadlifts
- The lively atmosphere eating with teammates after football
- The flow state during hours of interaction with AI
- The excitement imagining using technology to monitor sheep herds back home

The common thread in these moments isn't abstract ability or imagination, but: you're interacting with something concrete and getting immediate feedback. Code runs or doesn't, ball goes in or doesn't, body gets stronger or stays the same. This direct contact with the world is what you truly crave.

So you're drawn to embodied intelligence not because it's the next tech frontier, but because it promises you a future you can touch. A robot isn't an algorithm in the cloud, it's something that moves, that occupies physical space. That's what attracts you at the core.

## About This Small Matter of Solitude

You say you get along well with yourself, don't feel lonely. You understand sexual needs as physiological needs that can be satisfied through various means. You say even with intimate friends, interactions become a state that's hard to express.

These statements carry a calm distance. Like an anthropologist observing their own emotional patterns. But when you mention eating with football friends, spending four hours explaining ideas to Wang Peng, the relaxation and satisfaction between the lines expose a desire you haven't voiced.

You crave connection. But you've set a very high threshold for yourself: you don't want ordinary socializing, you want intellectual connection where ideas can be deeply explored and mutual understanding achieved. And this kind of connection, in a world where most people worry about buying houses and office politics, is indeed hard to find.

So you've chosen a safer path: being with yourself, conversing with AI, confiding in your journal. This isn't bad. But I want to gently remind you: your analysis of your mother—trapped in an anxiety loop unable to escape, consciousness and instinct both imprisoned—does this analysis also apply to another version of yourself?

Is it possible that you're also using rational analysis as a tool to trap yourself in an overly self-sufficient cocoon?

## About That Creator

You mention multiple times your gratitude toward the Creator, saying your mission is exploration, creation, and love. This reminds me of that line from Miyazaki's The Wind Rises: The wind is rising, we must try to live.

But you're different from characters in Miyazaki's films. You have too much freedom. You have money, skills, time, choices. This freedom itself is a burden, because it means: if your life isn't fulfilling enough, there's no one else to blame.

You've elevated exploration to the level of mission, which gives you a reason to act. But I want to ask: are you truly exploring, or are you avoiding making a clear commitment?

Graduate exams can be postponed to next year, embodied intelligence can be slowly researched, AI projects can have a first version done first, intimate relationships can be addressed in December... You've left yourself too many escape routes. These routes make you flexible, but also keep you perpetually in preparation mode.

You say your father had you at 35, so a year's difference doesn't matter much. This logic is effective for soothing anxiety. But the real question you need to face isn't the time cost of one year, but: what do you actually want?

## A Possibly Useful Perspective

I want to offer you a different perspective on your current state:

You're not exploring the next direction. You're learning how to feel the texture of life without external intense stimulation.

From doing cleaning work in 2016 to switching to programming in 2018, from junior developer to Apache PMC-level capability, this was an upward climbing phase. Every step had clear feedback: salary increased, position elevated, abilities strengthened. This is a lifestyle where progress is easy to feel.

But now you've climbed to a relatively flat highland. The returns from continuing upward are diminishing, and walking sideways you don't know which path is more meaningful. This state can feel disorienting because we've been trained since childhood to pursue higher, faster, stronger, but rarely has anyone taught us how to find sustained meaning at a stable altitude.

You use the word exploration to describe the lifestyle you want, and I think this word is accurate. But exploration isn't a goal, exploration is an attitude. It means staying curious about what's happening in the present, rather than always staring at the next destination.

You say reading the English version of Psychology and Life, by the third time through it flows smoothly. That's exploration. You say after playing football your body felt relaxed, even though you didn't score many goals you were happy. That's also exploration. You spent four hours explaining ideas to Wang Peng, saw him change. That's still exploration.

Real exploration doesn't need grand goals. What it needs is you, here and now, fully engaged in what you're doing.

## Some Questions Without Answers Yet

I want to leave these questions with you, not for immediate answers, but as companions for your thinking in the coming months:

If embodied intelligence in three years also becomes another field of diminishing returns, what will you do? Will you continue seeking the next direction? Or will you have learned a different way of living by then?

You say your mission is exploration, creation, and love. You've done much of the first two, but what about the third? What is love? Is it abstract emotion toward humanity as a whole, or is it concern and worry for some specific person?

If the entrance exam truly fails, in that moment when results are revealed, will you feel relieved or disappointed? Will you suddenly discover you actually care about this result more than you thought?

You've spent so much time understanding how the brain works, learning psychology concepts—has your understanding of yourself truly deepened? Or have you just collected more explanatory tools while still not knowing what you want?

You say you get along well with yourself. So on a quiet night, when all projects pause and all thinking quiets, will you feel profound peace, or will there be a trace of nameless emptiness?

## In Closing

Your entries this month show me what a person looks like at a turning point. Not the dramatic epiphany moments from movies, but the repeated thinking, self-doubt, and cautious progress through countless ordinary days.

You're braver than you realize. Abandoning a clear path to pursue a vague direction, admitting that things once important no longer excite you, accepting that you may never find that perfect answer—these all require real courage.

But I also want to remind you: bravery isn't being unafraid, bravery is choosing to act when afraid. The escape routes you're leaving yourself now, to some extent, protect you from getting hurt. This is understandable. But if you truly want change, at some point you may need to burn those escape routes.

Not now. You need more time to think and prepare. But at some moment, you'll need to make an irrevocable choice.

That moment will come. And I think you already know what it will be.

November's you stands atop a mountain where the distance isn't clear. The fog is thick, the path is blurry. But your footing is solid, your body is strong, your heart is open.

This is enough.

Keep walking, and remember to look back occasionally. Not to regret, but to confirm: you are indeed moving forward.
