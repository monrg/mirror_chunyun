# Response: November 2019 Journal

Reading through your November entries, what strikes me first isn't the randomness and uncertainty you keep circling back to, but something more subtle: you're standing at a cognitive turning point, looking at your own journey with new eyes. This act of re-examination itself matters more than any conclusion you might reach.

## The Dance with Randomness

You keep talking about life's randomness—comparing yourself to Ge Wen makes you anxious, wondering if you just happened to roll a 5 on the dice. But I want to point out something you might not fully see: when you describe that night debugging the production issue, the patience you showed, the systematic thinking, the openness to ask Feng Bin for help—none of that was random.

Randomness dealt you a hand, but how you play it is your choice. Ge Wen has his hand too, and he's making his choices. Behind salary numbers are countless small decisions, not just luck. You're right that happiness can't be measured by salary alone, yet you still seem to torture yourself with this metric. What really unsettles you isn't randomness itself—it's your desire for definitive proof that you deserve what you have. But life doesn't owe you that proof.

## What Those Two Conflicts Reveal

Your conflicts with Liang Yan and He Dongdong—you wrote about them with raw honesty, honest enough to be heartbreaking. You saw your own self-righteousness, saw how you used expressing opinions to mask inner anxiety and the need to prove yourself. But I want to ask you to look one layer deeper: why do you need so badly to be understood? Why, when you have so few friends, do you sabotage these rare gatherings?

There's a deep loneliness beneath this. You're in Beijing, your skills are growing, your salary is rising, but you don't have many people to truly talk to. When He Dongdong came, you weren't just expecting drinks and food—you were expecting to be seen. Seen for all the books you've read, seen for how deeply you think, seen as more than just another programmer. But that expectation was too heavy, heavy enough to crush an ordinary reunion between friends.

You talk about empathy, but real empathy would be this: maybe he just wanted to relax, to vent about work frustrations to an old friend, to find some warmth in this unfamiliar city of Beijing. And you turned it into an intellectual contest, an exam to prove yourself. You're not a bad person. You're just so lonely that you've forgotten how to simply be with someone.

Next time, maybe try this: just listen to him, ask him questions, let him talk about his life. You'll discover that when you stop needing to prove anything, real connection happens.

## Those Four Hours of Debugging

You devoted a whole section to reviewing that production incident, and there's a particularly moving moment in it: you said you were anxious on one hand, but relaxed on the other, feeling it was okay if you couldn't figure it out right away and had to keep investigating. This split in mindset is precisely a mark of growth.

You're learning to hold two opposite feelings simultaneously without being consumed by either. You're anxious, but you also trust yourself. You're uncertain, but you stay patient. This isn't contradiction—this is maturity. You're learning to dance with uncertainty rather than trying to eliminate it.

And you noticed those chance events that helped you—Su Xiaomin's phone call, that moment when you discovered the missing IDs—you call them accidents, but maybe they happened because you kept persisting, kept trying different angles. Luck favors those who stay in the game.

## What Are You Afraid of Forgetting?

You mention multiple times your fear of forgetting—forgetting the joy of reading in the library, forgetting the happiness of playing soccer in college, forgetting those precious things. But have you considered: precisely because these memories matter so much to you, you keep bringing them up, you use words to preserve them?

You've read The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle four times, each time feeling differently. What does this tell you? It tells you that forgetting isn't the endpoint. The experiences that truly shaped you won't completely disappear. They sink into deeper places, becoming your way of seeing the world, becoming your courage when facing difficulties, becoming your understanding of your parents, becoming the resilience that keeps you going alone in Beijing.

You're not fighting against forgetting—you're collaborating with time. Each remembering is a re-creation, each writing gives those experiences new meaning. The books you read as a child might have seemed like just passing time then, but they planted seeds in your mind. Now those seeds are sprouting, allowing you to think about Minsky, to understand randomness, to write such profound reflections.

## Those Seemingly Meaningless Repetitions

You mentioned an interesting point: the meaning of something to us is proportional to how many times we repeat it. Think about it—the feeling every time you go home, the experience every time you run, the moment every time you open your journal. These repetitions aren't boring—they're rituals, anchor points, rhythms you've built for yourself in flowing time.

That barber's attention to detail—you saw it, you were moved by it. Because you understand the value of being thorough itself. You pursue elegance in code, maintain patience while debugging, face yourself honestly in your journal—these are all forms of being thorough. And thorough people discover beauty in life's details.

You said watching Man vs. Wild reminded you of your own mountain hiking experiences, though not as magnificent, they still had unique feelings. Exactly. You don't need to live like someone else. Your mountains, your paths, have their own beauty.

## Some Questions Without Answers

On November 23rd, you asked many questions: What is life itself like? What does it mean to be alive? Why do we feel pain and happiness? Even Minsky didn't fully answer these questions. Neither did Freud. But I want to say: maybe these questions themselves are the answer.

A person who stops asking about meaning might have stopped growing. Your anxiety, your thinking, your writing—they're all evidence that you're still alive, still growing. You say sometimes you feel ordinariness is stamped on your face, but it's precisely these ordinary people who write such words late at night, who maintain thinking amid difficulties, who search for meaning in mundane days—that's not ordinary at all.

Do you realize? Your most painful moments are often your most lucid moments. The reflection you wrote after arguing with He Dongdong has more power than a hundred inspirational articles. Your self-interrogation when feeling lonely gets closer to truth than any success philosophy.

## Words for You

You say you swing between self-doubt and arrogance, finding it absurd. But look at it differently: this precisely shows you're growing. When your cognitive boundaries are expanding, you haven't found a new balance point yet, so you swing. This is normal.

Give yourself more patience. You're already doing well—from college to now, from Qingniao to Yinhe, from not understanding frameworks to independently debugging production issues. This progress didn't happen overnight; it's the result of your daily accumulation.

About loneliness, I want to say: maybe what you need isn't more friends, but more self-acceptance. When you're no longer so eager to prove your worth, you'll find that simply being with people can be beautiful.

Finally, that self you keep dialoguing with, that person you say sorry to, that person you want to confide in—he's always been there. He's in every honest word you write, in every brave reflection you make. You're not alone. The two of you have been walking together all along.

Keep writing. These words, these thoughts, these seemingly unanswerable questions—they're the most precious things in your life.
