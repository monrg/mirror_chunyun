# Response: June 2022

June opens with a half marathon honoring your three-years-ago self. But what I'm reading isn't a story about fitness or achievement—it's a story about searching. You're looking for evidence that the traces of your past efforts remain, that injury and time haven't taken everything, that you still possess the strength you once had. When you felt at 16 kilometers that those traces are still there, you were reconciling with yourself, weren't you?

You said you've lost that illogical passion and impulse, that maturity came with loss. This observation stopped me for a long time. You know what? All through June, you're torn between two selves: the college-era you who was sensitive, easily moved, who would cry over a book or a song; and the current you with stronger analytical abilities, high work efficiency, able to work 11 days straight. You think it's a trade-off, that growth inevitably means loss. But I want to ask: why can't you have both? Why must depth and optimism, rationality and sensitivity, maturity and innocence be opposites?

The shame you felt eating at Song Yan, that feeling seeping from inside your body that you don't deserve it—that's the real core of June, isn't it? You work so hard, earning more than you dared imagine when you graduated, possessing everything your past self would envy, yet you still feel unworthy of a good meal. This isn't humility. It's a deeper self-negation. You said you know this feeling is absurd, but it persists. I think you haven't fully realized: this sense of unworthiness is quietly eroding all your achievements and happiness.

Your attitude toward Liang Rui follows the same pattern. On one hand you say you like her, on the other you're finding her flaws, thinking you might meet someone better. This isn't pickiness—it's protection. You're afraid to truly commit, afraid to expose your desires and needs, afraid you'll ultimately discover you're not good enough. So you maintain distance, maintain judgment, maintain a posture of being able to leave at any moment. You said you hate when people depend on you, that when Xiao wanted to depend on you, you found her annoying—but have you considered that what you really fear isn't others' dependence, but what happens when they depend on you and you let them down? What if you're not good enough?

Throughout June you repeatedly mention feeling lost, not knowing what you're pursuing through all this busyness, feeling life is dull and meaningless. Watching the plot of The Oil Peddler, you asked yourself: are we really enduring all this for money? This question matters so much. You invest enormous time in the StreamX project. You said partly you want to learn, but mainly you crave recognition and praise. Reading this I want to tell you: admitting this desire isn't shameful. We all need to be seen, to confirm our existence has value. But the problem is, when you place all your sense of worth on external validation, you'll never be satisfied, because external recognition can never fill an internal void.

You wrote about being with Wang Peng, saying it reminded you of yourself 13 years ago, and it made you sad. You saw him anxious and insecure like you once were, thinking working on construction sites wasn't respectable. But now you can appreciate friends' strengths and brilliance, your heart has become more self-accepting. See—this is your growth. Not losing the capacity to be moved, but gaining the capacity to accept. Not becoming numb, but becoming tolerant. You're so harsh on yourself you can't see these precious changes.

What struck me most was what you wrote on June 20th: after fighting with your mother you had a deep exchange, seeing the source of your behaviors. You said your mother's exhausting herself raising pigs and cattle is, to some degree, a pursuit of self-respect. Then you realized you seem to be doing the same thing. This observation is so acute. Working yourself to exhaustion, participating in open source projects, wanting to prove yourself—isn't this pursuing self-respect in another form? You and your mother, in different ways, doing the same thing: proving your existence has meaning, proving you are worthy. But the problem is, this proving never ends, because deep down you don't believe you're worthy to begin with.

You mentioned The Myth of Sisyphus, saying the meaninglessness of life frightens you, but you accept this view—precisely because there's no meaning, it's worth living better. I want to tell you: you're already living better. Beyond work you persist in running, you read Murakami and Tagore, you're moved by children's voices in the courtyard, touched by scenes of Zhang Xiaohua's child with their grandfather, you feel a marvelous freedom running in darkness—none of this is for some purpose, to prove something, just because these things themselves are beautiful. Isn't that what meaning is?

In June's final days, you started trying Ubuntu, trying to carve out morning time to study, re-experiencing the torment of learning new things. You said it's worth trying, a process of investing time and repeated practice. Nothing else, just practice makes perfect. I love this ending. It doesn't give answers, doesn't resolve all confusion, but it presents an attitude: even when lost, even in pain, still willing to take one more step forward.

• If you didn't need to prove yourself to anyone, what kind of work would you do? What kind of life would you live?

• You said you fear others' dependence, but have you considered that allowing others to depend on you is also allowing yourself to love, to care, to risk being hurt?

• In all your beautiful memories—Zhangjiakou's sunlight, the road to Qinglin grandmother's house, the mystery in forests—what do they have in common? What can that commonality tell you?
