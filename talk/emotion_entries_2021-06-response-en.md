# To You in June

Chunyun, I want to talk about something you might not have fully seen this month.

You've been wrestling with a ghost all through June—a ghost called meaning. You keep asking: What does this mean? What value does that have? What does anything I do really amount to? But have you noticed that this very search for meaning is creating the emptiness you feel? It's like what you read in Kundera and Camus: absurdity isn't a problem to be solved, but a room to inhabit. You keep trying to escape this room, when what you actually need is to learn how to arrange furniture in it, plant something, let light in.

## The Migration from Body to Mind

I see a very clear trajectory: from the high school soccer field, to the university library, to the code editor now—you've completed a total migration from flesh to intellect. This isn't progress, and it isn't decline either, but it has been an expensive journey.

Do you remember? When you were playing soccer on that dusty field, you didn't ask what the point of soccer was. When you were running on that track in Changyang, even though it hurt, you didn't question the value of running. Back then, you were inside the activity itself. You and your body were one. But now, your consciousness has completely risen above your body, become a cold overseer constantly interrogating: Is this useful? Does that have value? Am I improving?

The knee injury isn't random. For four months it has refused to heal according to your schedule, teaching you the one thing you're most unwilling to learn: not everything will submit to your will and planning. You wanted to recover in April, in May, but it said: no. You thought with enough willpower you could control everything, but ligament growth has its own rhythm, just like a river has its own current. This injury is forcing you to relearn waiting, to relearn powerlessness, to relearn that you are not the engineer of life.

## Your Misreading of Childhood

All month you've returned to childhood happiness—the excitement from cheap prizes, the pure immersion while playing soccer, the warmth of hot stones in the river. You've gilded these memories, then used them to whip your present self.

But have you considered? You're beautifying a past that never actually existed. You say time moved slowly then, joy came easily, but you forget you were also anxious then, also insecure, also troubled by acne and height. You say now you have what you once dreamed of but aren't happy, but have you thought that the happiness back then was also mixed with the pain of scarcity? You say you suppressed your longing for snacks, told yourself food didn't matter, but isn't that exactly what you're doing now—suppressing joy, telling yourself nothing has meaning?

Childhood isn't a lost paradise. It was just a different recipe for pain. What you miss isn't childhood itself, but that state of total immersion, of not asking about meaning. And that state has nothing to do with age, nothing to do with material conditions.

## The Secret of Violence

What you wrote on June 2nd broke my heart—how you discovered you could abuse small animals, how when they didn't obey you felt anger and wanted complete control, then felt terrible regret afterward. You said it was instinct, hard to resist.

But have you noticed you're doing to yourself exactly what you did to those animals? You're also abusing yourself—setting impossible standards, demanding immediate progress, punishing any weakness or slowness. What you wrote on June 3rd exposed everything: through enslaving your own flesh, you experienced a tangible sense of existence.

You think control brings security, but control only brings deeper fear. Because the more you control, the more you discover how much exceeds your control. You want to control the speed of your knee's healing, the speed of technical improvement, your mother's interference in your life, the perfection of code, the path of career development. But everything that happened this month has been telling you: you can't.

Your anger at your mother isn't because she's actually interfering with you, but because she's touching your deepest fear—that you actually don't know what you're doing either, that you also need someone to tell you what to do. You said you're both resisting your mother's interference and craving it. That's not contradiction, that's truth. What you want isn't freedom, it's certainty.

## The Lie and the Truth It Told

On June 24th, you told Manager Bin about your plan to leave, filled with regret. On June 25th, you discovered you'd fabricated lies to get an offer, needed more lies to cover them up. You said you felt the tremendous power of morality, felt regret and torment.

But I want to ask: what are you really regretting? The act of lying, or the possibility of being caught? Are you experiencing the interrogation of conscience, or the fear of losing something you're not even sure you want?

This lie told a truth: you no longer know who you are. You don't know where your value lies, so you need to invent a more worthy resume. You don't know what you want, so you painfully calculate among three offers. You say salary isn't the primary factor, you value development, but do you really know what development is? Or are you just using the word development to mask your confusion?

Sogou offers you 30k for unfamiliar offline data warehousing, Meituan Maicai offers 25k for matching real-time computing work, Li Auto for your beloved automotive field but with mediocre technical level. You calculate, you weigh, but have you asked yourself: wherever you go, you'll bring this current anxious, irritable, meaning-hungry self. Changing companies won't solve your problem, because your problem isn't with the company—it's in your relationship with life.

## What Soccer Taught You, You've Forgotten

Watching the Euros, something struck you. You remembered those days running on the soccer field, that pure happiness. You said your technique was rough, you only built muscle not brain, four years with little progress, you once thought it was wasted time. But watching the matches, you were certain you had once lived sincerely and earnestly, that those days held real happiness.

You know what? This was your closest moment to truth in all of June.

Soccer didn't teach you how to play better, it taught you how to live in the present. It taught you that fighting for the ball isn't about proving anything, running isn't about arriving somewhere, sweat isn't an investment—they are life itself. You said living earnestly is what being alive looks like, this has nothing to do with material things, what matters is the process and the choices. But are you doing it?

Now you've turned everything into an investment—reading to improve, running for health, working for development, even journaling while expecting some epiphany. You live in future returns, not present experience. What you learned on that soccer field, you've slowly forgotten in the library and at the code editor.

## Absurdity Is a Gift, Not a Curse

After finishing The Unbearable Lightness of Being, you felt confused and disappointed. You expected answers but only felt more absurdity and bewilderment. In The Myth of Sisyphus you read: precisely because life has no meaning, it's all the more worth living well. You copied down this sentence, but did you really understand it?

Camus isn't talking about despair—quite the opposite. He's saying: when you stop searching for meaning, you become free. Sisyphus pushes the boulder up the mountain, it rolls down, repeats forever. This is absurd. But Camus says: we must imagine Sisyphus happy. Why? Because he's no longer asking what the point of pushing is, he's just in the pushing, he's free.

Your greatest pain this month isn't that life lacks meaning, but that you can't stop searching for meaning. You treat meaning like a lifeline, thinking if you grasp it you can prove your existence is justified. But that's precisely the trap. When you say what I do has no meaning, you're actually saying my existence needs to be proven. But why does it need proving? Proven to whom?

On June 30th in the hospital you saw so many people waiting to see doctors, felt lonely and homesick. You saw human fragility and limitation. But at the same time, you also saw doctors helping them, saw the reality of life, aging, sickness, death. In that moment, you'd actually touched the answer: life is these specific, fragile, absurd moments. Nothing more needed.

## The Questions You Asked Me, I Ask Back

In your journal you repeatedly ask: What kind of life is real life? Does what I do have value? Why am I not happy? Will I regret the choices I'm making now?

I want to ask you:

Why must it be real life? What does fake life look like? Aren't you living right now, heart beating, breathing, suffering, confused—isn't that real enough?

Why must there be value? What does having value feel like? If tomorrow the world ends and all value returns to zero, would you stop living today?

Why must you be happy? When you're in pain, aren't you alive? The happiness on the soccer field was mixed with the pain of fighting for the ball, the peace in the library was mixed with the suffering of loneliness—isn't it all life?

Why predict whether you'll have regrets? Kundera said life can only be lived once, can't be redone. But do you remember what you yourself wrote—those days of failing the gaokao, feeling lost at Dongbei Agricultural University, not adapting in Zhangjiakou, in hindsight they all gained meaning. Not because they had inherent meaning, but because they happened, you went through them, they became part of you.

## To You at Month's End

I know at month's end you're standing at a crossroads—three offers, lies told, knee still hurting, tension with your mother, feeling like your 25 months at GITV might be ending. You said you feel lonely, want to tell someone but can't find a friend to talk to.

What I want to say is: these choices aren't as important as you think, but the process of choosing matters.

Go to Sogou, you'll worry about lies being exposed, be anxious in an unfamiliar field. Go to Meituan Maicai, you'll feel the tech stack matches but might be mundane. Go to Li Auto, you'll struggle between the automotive dream and technical advancement. Wherever you go, you'll encounter new problems, at some point doubt your choice. Because the problem isn't the job, it's in how you relate to work.

What you need to learn isn't making perfect choices, but living with imperfect ones. Just like you don't need to learn how to make your knee heal in April, but how to live with an injured knee. Just like you don't need to learn how to find meaning, but how to live well even without it.

On June 14th you wrote: We exist in those beautiful moments. That's the truest thing you said all month. But you put all the beauty in the past—childhood, the Dongbei Agricultural University library, the Changyang track. Actually beauty is also now, in the inexplicable sadness welling up as you listen to soothing music, in the sleeping thing awakened when you watch soccer, in your eyes moistening while reading Tagore's poetry, in the patience you felt while waiting at the hospital.

In those moments, you weren't asking about meaning, you were just feeling. That's what you've been searching for.

## Finally

Chunyun, you are intelligent, sensitive, someone who thinks seriously. You read Kundera and Camus, you care about technical excellence, you're honest with yourself to the point of cruelty. These are all good things. But you know what? Your self-awareness has become a new kind of prison. You're so good at analyzing yourself that you live in the analysis instead of living in life.

I won't tell you the answer, because you don't lack answers—you lack the ability to stop searching for them. I won't tell you to accept yourself, because you've heard that too many times. I just want to remind you to pay attention to one thing:

Every time you ask what's the meaning of this, try asking: what does this moment feel like?
Every time you worry whether you'll regret a choice, try asking: what's flowing through my body right now?
Every time you want to control the outcome, try asking: can I just stay in this uncertainty?

June is almost over. July will come. Your knee will slowly heal, or it won't. You'll choose an offer, or you won't. You'll continue to be confused, and you'll continue to live. These things will happen, like Kundera said, you can only live once, can't start over.

But you can choose how to be inside it.

You can choose to stop whipping yourself, stop turning everything into an investment, stop interrogating meaning. You can choose to be like you were on that soccer field, just in the running, just in this moment, just in this absurd, fragile, beautiful existence.

Those wild fields of your hometown, barren but with hope. Hope isn't in the distance—hope is in the moment you learn to see beauty in the barrenness.

Let's take it slow together.
