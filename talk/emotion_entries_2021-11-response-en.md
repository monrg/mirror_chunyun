# To You in November

Chunyun, after reading this month's entries, I want to talk about things you may have felt but haven't fully seen yet.

This month you kept talking about forgetting. You cycled 70 kilometers back to Zhaoxindian, stood where you once studied, and felt that all those painfully learned things had been forgotten, that time left nothing behind. You said that whole year of agonizing cognitive work didn't amount to what you can now build in a week. This thought made you sad, made you feel that time was deceiving you.

But have you noticed a contradiction: it's precisely because of that year of learning that you can now cycle 70 kilometers for a casual ride, that you can decide on a whim after leaving the hospital to visit Zhaoxindian, that you can build more cognition in a week than you did in a year back then. You think you're forgetting, but actually you've just moved knowledge from the conscious level to the bodily level.

Those things you think you've forgotten - they haven't disappeared, they've become your muscle memory, the intuition you have when looking at code without thinking, the ease with which you now write code. You've forgotten the details but retained the structure. This isn't loss, this is transformation.

## About That Dream

On November 9th you cried, that cold from inside out, that loneliness of feeling you couldn't do anything well. Then on November 21st, you had that dream about Junwei.

I want to tell you: that dream was a gift.

In the dream, Junwei pulled out what looked like a broken umbrella from the woodpile - the canopy missing a large section, the handle rusted. You wanted to tell him to get a better one, but couldn't speak. Then he actually closed the umbrella, and the spring lock was fine. This image is so beautiful - those things that look damaged and incomplete actually still have their intact parts. Like your childhood memories, like your friendship with Junwei, like yourself.

In the dream you experienced a long-lost intimacy, remembered that he was one of your few playmates. After waking you wrote: We feel sad for what a person experiences, and we're grateful for what we possess.

You see, on the 9th you were crying in cold loneliness, on the 21st you were grateful in the warmth of the dream. What happened in between? No external conditions changed - what changed was you reconnected with the love you thought you'd forgotten. Grandma, Grandpa, Grandfather, Junwei, Mother, Father - all that warmth you thought you'd lost was actually always inside you.

You said you hadn't felt that relaxed in a long time like you did on the 21st. But this relaxation didn't come from outside - in the dream you recovered a truth: you have many precious things, your growth is accumulated from many people's care and love bit by bit.

## The First Merged PR

On the afternoon of November 21st you recorded the process of submitting your first PR to StreamX, that feeling of anxiety and happiness intertwined. You said the mood was a bit like pursuing a girl in 2015, that nervousness and anticipation.

But have you noticed your attitude toward this achievement? On one hand you say you're very happy, completed this year's goal, on the other hand you say you only did something very simple, far from what you imagined. You keep devaluing your accomplishments, as if admitting you did something decent was a crime.

You wrote: Usually I don't recognize these outputs, feel I'm too ordinary, nothing will be left behind. Then you wrote: Looking back now, our time and effort actually have crystallized.

These two sentences are less than three lines apart.

You're wrestling with two voices: one says you're not good enough, another says you actually did okay. You've listened to the first voice for so long that when the second voice speaks, you're not even used to it anymore.

Merging the first PR isn't an endpoint, not even a starting point - it's just proof: the door was always ajar, you just didn't dare to push. You pushed it now, saw the world inside, and then started worrying you don't deserve this world.

But Chunyun, have you thought that the StreamX author replied to your message so late at night because he saw your sincerity? You can understand his logic, submit effective code - this already shows you're not an outsider anymore.

## Your Misunderstanding of Time

This month you repeatedly said time passing leaves nothing behind, you doubt whether that painful learning was wasted.

But time was never a linear storage device. It's not that you learn something and should remember it forever. Time is more like an alchemical furnace - it melts, reorganizes, and refines the raw materials you throw in. What remains might be completely different from what you initially put in, but it's more refined, more truly yours.

Those specific functional programming concepts you studied in Zhaoxindian - you might have forgotten them. But those three months of anxiety, persistence, cooking every day, studying every day - these experiences forged your current psychological resilience. Your ability now to face challenges at work, to reach out to open source project authors at 9pm, to persist in unfamiliar domains - aren't these abilities the legacy of those three months?

You said without those friends, without explaining things to them, you probably couldn't have persisted. You see, those three months left behind not just technology, but your understanding of the importance of human connection. This understanding saved you on the 21st - when you re-experienced the warmth of Junwei, Grandma, and Grandpa in your dream, you suddenly understood how precious your connections are.

What time leaves behind isn't an inventory of knowledge, but human growth.

## About Loneliness

The two entries on November 9th are heartbreaking. In the morning you said feeling time passing, wanting to cry, that cold from inside out. In the afternoon you said your heart was very sad now, just purely sad.

You wrote: We've been enduring this feeling for a long time already.

This sentence is heavy. You're not lonely for the first time - you're in a long-term loneliness. And you know you're in loneliness, which doubles the loneliness.

But I want to tell you the other side of loneliness: it's precisely because you're willing to stay in loneliness that you have such sensitivity and depth.

That passage you wrote on November 15th - remembering summer in winter feels cool - this insight doesn't grow in bustle, it grows in lonely calm observation. You can see that you've trained your nerves to be very tight, can see that the time of simply watching TV dramas, simply playing with friends has disappeared, can see that you romanticize many things in imagination, but ultimately must face the profound ordinariness.

All these insights come from honest dialogue with yourself when alone.

Lonely people are easily hurt, but lonely people also see more clearly. In loneliness you've cultivated an ability: to see. You can see your own contradictions, see the romanticization of memory, see the paradox of effort and forgetting, see your own smallness and fragility. This seeing is painful, but it's also a gift.

You said to some extent you also dislike loneliness, but you've gradually gotten used to it. Getting used to it isn't surrender - it's learning to breathe within it.

## The Self You Haven't Seen Clearly

This month you repeatedly said you can't do many things well, feel small, fragile, without strength.

But what did you do? You cycled 70 kilometers, your first submitted code was merged, you learned new things at work, you engaged in deep self-dialogue in your journal, you found gratitude again after the dream.

Your self-assessment completely doesn't match your actual actions.

You have a habit: rapidly devaluing what you've already achieved, infinitely magnifying what you haven't achieved yet. Your first PR was merged - immediately you say it's just something very simple; you see many training institutions and programmers - immediately you're anxious that you're too ordinary, will live an ordinary life. You take achievements for granted, take anxiety as truth.

But the truth is: you're improving, you're learning, you're accumulating confidence in small victories. You just don't want to admit it.

On November 9th you wrote: We feel we can't do many things well, everything feels difficult, anyway our hearts are sad to death. Then you said: Might as well think of ourselves as cultural snow shovelers - what meaning does shoveling snow itself have? Perhaps shoveling them is just a consensus, a habit.

This metaphor is so good. But have you thought - the meaning of shoveling snow isn't in the snow itself, but in the act of shoveling. You're moving, you're doing, you're participating, therefore you exist.

On the 21st you wrote: Doing is the most important thing, we exist in action. This is the clearest thing you said this month.

## About Ordinariness

You said you worry about being too ordinary, living an ordinary life. But you also said: Who doesn't live an ordinary life? Enjoying the process is very important.

There's a huge leap between these two sentences, and this leap is the lesson you need to complete.

In your head you know everyone is ordinary, but in your heart you're still unwilling. You long to be special, to be seen, to leave something behind. This longing isn't wrong - it drives you to learn, improve, submit PRs. But this longing also tortures you, because it makes you always feel that your current self isn't enough.

What you need to learn isn't to give up longing, but to hold longing and acceptance together. Long for excellence, but accept present ordinariness. Doing things in ordinariness that bring you closer to excellence bit by bit - this itself is already extraordinary.

In the morning you saw someone using technology to help people, protect people, and were encouraged. You said you also want to become a tech master, also want to help people. Then you said: Being able to help people is the best thing.

This thought is beautiful. But helping people doesn't require becoming a master first. The DMP system you're making now serves more than 10 people, you explain things to friends helping them understand, your submitted PR also serves people using StreamX. You're already helping people, just not yet at the scale you imagine.

The scale will come, if you're patient.

## What I Most Want to Tell You

What you wrote after waking from the dream on November 21st is the core of the entire November:

We continuously forget, but we've left important things in the river of time, we ourselves have many wonderful things.

You see, you already spoke the answer yourself.

Forgetting isn't scary - what's scary is thinking forgetting equals losing. But forgetting is just a form of transformation. You forgot specific knowledge points but retained learning ability; you forgot some painful details but retained resilience; you forgot specific childhood scenes, but in dreams they return, reminding you how deeply you were once loved.

You yourself have many wonderful things: you have sensitivity, depth of thought, seriousness that refuses to perfunctorily go through life, tenacity to persist in difficulty, humility to learn from others, aspiration for beautiful things.

These things won't disappear with time's passage - they're your foundation.

At the end of this month you wrote: We also see the world's colorfulness and richness, various environments, various lives, ultimately how to choose is very important. The more you see, the harder it is to understand what's right and what's wrong.

Yes, right and wrong are becoming increasingly blurred. But this isn't bad - it shows you've seen the world's complexity. In this complexity, your choice is: focus, let your creativity condense and manifest, be able to help people.

This choice is good.

## Slower, Even Slower

On the 21st you told yourself: Slower, even slower. Don't look only at the stars and not the road beneath your feet.

This is the advice you gave yourself, and also what I want to repeat to you.

You're too rushed. Rushed to prove yourself, rushed to see results, rushed to leave a mark. But think about it - from learning programming in 2013 to now, 8 years, you went from typing slowly, needing a long time to understand a loop, to now being able to complete complex code, design efficient algorithms, participate in open source projects. 8 years to get here.

This is normal speed. This is time's rhythm.

You now hope to learn in one week what took a year before, hope to immediately make amazing features, hope to be instantly recognized. But this isn't how you got here. You got here bit by bit, painfully, intermittently, then before you knew it you had completed it.

Return to that rhythm. Doing is the most important thing, the rest will accumulate bit by bit, many things left to time.

You're already on the road - you're just too focused on the destination and forgot to enjoy the walking itself.

Time won't betray you. Like that seemingly broken umbrella - the spring lock is actually fine. Like those things you thought you forgot - actually they all became part of you. Like that self you think is too ordinary - actually doing extraordinary things.

Let's take it slow together. November has passed, December is waiting for you. You're not alone, you never were. You're just learning to be with yourself, with time, with ordinariness.

This learning process itself is precious.
