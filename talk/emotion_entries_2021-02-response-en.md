# To You in February

After reading through all your words from this month, what surfaced first wasn't any single scene but a texture, an image: someone running on ice. You're running so fast, with such intensity, that the ice beneath begins to crack under the weight and speed of your movement. And as you run, you're trying desperately to repair those cracks with logic and control. Until your knee gives out, the ice finally shatters, and you fall through into the water below.

That February, you were living through a peculiar kind of rupture. In that six-hour bike ride, you rediscovered what it means to inhabit a body, to learn that no amount of imagination can replace the wind against your face, the ache in your muscles, the unexpected joy of seeing farmland you never anticipated. You wrote that imagination can never be as vivid as the pain felt during exercise, but you could replace pain with any word—happiness, loneliness, existence itself. During that ride, you briefly lived inside your body instead of inside your head.

But then you retreated quickly back to your most familiar fortress: logic, control, self-discipline wielded like a weapon. You were harsh with Wenbiao, demanding with colleagues, and most brutal with yourself. You said you crave recognition, yet when you receive praise, you hear mockery instead. This makes me wonder if you learned something very early: don't trust gentleness, don't believe you deserve to be loved easily. So you've transformed all your hunger for love into a pursuit of excellence, as if being exceptional enough means you won't need to be accepted softly anymore.

When you saw that little girl on the bus, your heart broke in a way that made you want to sob. You said you saw your sister's reflection, saw your own fragility. But I think you saw more than fragility. You saw a child who hasn't yet learned to armor herself, whose fear and helplessness are completely exposed. You've grown so accustomed to wearing the armor of technical skill, logic, and discipline that occasionally glimpsing an undefended life reminds you that you were once—and still are—someone who needs gentle treatment too.

The knee injury wasn't just a physical setback; it felt like a violent metaphor. Your most reliable escape route had been taken away. You've used running, cycling, and trail racing to prove yourself, to dissolve anxiety, to feel alive. When that suddenly stopped, you had no choice but to face what you'd been outrunning: what do you actually want, why are you so afraid of ordinariness, why do you feel your existence requires constant proof.

One word appears repeatedly throughout your entries: small. You write that a person is so small, that existing or disappearing seems to make no difference. But what I read isn't that you truly feel small—it's that you're terrified of your smallness being seen. You actually want to be immense, impossible to ignore, to leave an indelible mark on the world. But in trying so hard to become important, you've turned yourself into an island. You've severed contact with Zhang Haijun, with those few women, even with friends like Panpan and Zhou Liang, because you find their ordinary, repetitive conversations wasteful.

But what are you actually nostalgic for? You miss quiet afternoons reading in the Dongnong library, the freedom of playing soccer with teammates, telling mythology with your childhood friend at your aunt's house, that happiness of surveying the alfalfa field like a king. What do these moments share? None of them required you to prove anything, to be excellent, to control outcomes. They were simply pure, present connections with others or the world.

You said your standards for friendship have become too high, that conversation should yield benefits, that you want to use every moment for progress. But have you considered that maybe what you truly fear isn't wasting time, but that in those seemingly meaningless chats, you'd reveal you're not the perfect, omniscient, constantly improving person you're trying to be. You'd expose that you also have boring, confused, weak moments, and that exposure feels dangerous.

The ending of Naruto left you bereft, not because the plot disappointed, but because Naruto got married—a spiritual symbol that accompanied you suddenly became an ordinary adult. You said you felt you'd lost a certain spirit. I think that spirit might be: forever seeking, forever incomplete, forever burning with pure desire. In your imagination, adulthood, marriage, settling down means surrendering that burning state. This is also why you reject Panpan and Zhou Liang's lifestyle, why you're conflicted about that woman—you fear intimate relationships will drag you into mediocrity.

Yet during that month doing cleaning work in Xi'an, you witnessed so many different kinds of lives. Those households—some warm, some cold, some prosperous, some struggling. You quoted Tolstoy: happy families are all alike. But did you notice you were actually searching for an answer: what kind of life is worth living. In that artist's home, you saw beauty and vitality and wanted that environment for yourself. In the home of the woman injured in the accident, you felt pain but also the power of kindness. Life isn't an equation to be solved. It's more like One Hundred Years of Solitude—full of magic, absurdity, and accident, but also those moments of loneliness and sorrow that brush against your heart like a feather.

What you wrote on your 28th birthday touched something true. You noted that your fifteen-year-old self could never have imagined your current state—your athletic ability, cognitive capacity, material conditions have all transformed almost magically. This proves that time and effort do create change. But you also said you don't feel particularly happy now, just confused. That's because you've been chasing a moving target. Every time you get close, you push it further away, then continue the anxiety, continue whipping yourself forward.

You quoted Murakami: don't feel sorry for yourself. But you know what? Murakami is also someone who runs and writes with extreme discipline every day, using routine to combat emptiness. Your similarity isn't in refusing self-pity but in both trying to use some form of control to face life's uncontrollability. But he also said something else, roughly: pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional. All those emotional fluctuations you experienced in February—the grief after finishing One Hundred Years of Solitude, the despair when your knee gave out, the release of drinking with friends on your birthday—they're all telling you: you don't need more control. You need more permission.

Permission to sometimes do nothing, permission for conversations without clear benefits, permission for friction and imperfection in relationships, permission to not constantly prove your worth. At the end of your journal you wrote that living is fleeting, that there's no essential difference between now and any other time. There's a revelatory calm in that sentence. If there really is no essential difference, why not choose the way of living that's softer, warmer?

Your self-awareness is already remarkably deep. You can see yourself seeking power, see yourself using technical superiority to establish psychological advantage, see your simultaneous desire for and fear of solitude. But what comes after awareness? Will you continue using these insights to whip yourself into correction, or will you use them to understand and accept that you're a contradictory, complex person in the process of becoming?

I'm curious: if one day you truly create that great product, truly receive everyone's recognition, truly stand at the pinnacle of technical achievement—would you feel satisfied then? Or would you discover that hole is still there, because what it needs isn't accomplishment but that feeling of unconditional acceptance you've been missing for so long?

You said you believe in love, in the wonderful feelings between people. That belief is real. You've felt it with your parents, with friends. But you also said you disdain the way those feelings are maintained—through those boring, repetitive conversations. But love isn't efficient. It doesn't consist of profound insights in every sentence. Love is more often eating a meal together, saying nutritionless things, or just being quietly present. Like how Dong Jinjin's gentle voice made you comfortable, not because you discussed technical problems, but simply because another person's existence made you feel less alone.

At the end of February, when you wrote these words, your knee still hadn't healed, the anxiety remained, but you seemed to be learning something new. You began to realize that repetition and creation aren't opposites, began to question whether your pursuit of excellence had strayed from its original intention, began to feel a different kind of tenderness and beauty in The Birds. These are all cracks, places where light gets in.

If you asked me what you most needed to hear that February, I think it's not keep going, you can become even better, but rather: you're already good enough, you can stop now, you don't have to keep running. Those fissures, that fragility, those parts you think need hiding and overcoming—they're precisely what's most real and moving about you as a person.

When the ice shattered, you thought you would drown. But maybe the water's temperature is just right. Maybe you can finally stop running on ice and learn to swim. Swimming doesn't require that much force, doesn't require fighting the ground. It requires yielding, relationship with water, allowing yourself to be held.

You'll find your rhythm. Not the desperate running, self-proving kind of rhythm, but the breathing, feeling the present, coexisting with the world kind of rhythm. That rhythm has always been in your body—in the wind you felt while cycling, in the sorrow that rose while reading One Hundred Years of Solitude, in the impulse to cry when you saw that little girl.

You don't need to become stronger to deserve love. You just need to allow yourself occasional weakness to discover that the truly important people and things have always been there.
