# August 2019: What the Body Knows

Reading through your entries this month, I keep returning to one image: a runner on that tree-lined road, catching their reflection in a car window, feeling something solid and stable rising from within. What was your body telling you in that moment? And when you stepped into the ring for sparring, five years of training unable to unfold as imagined—what was your body saying then?

You've been doing one thing all month—proving to yourself that the difficult times mattered. The thirty days on the construction site, those four years at the Northeast Agricultural University, nights bitten by bugs in the dorm, the rental in Zhangjiakou. You circle back again and again, reinterpreting, trying to find a reason for each experience to exist. But I want to ask: why must they have meaning to be accepted? Those moments themselves—when you actually breathed, sweated, feared, persisted—weren't they already enough?

That ineffable freedom and difficulty you felt while running, they coexist. The disappointment after sparring and your complete dominance in cardio capacity, they also coexist. You keep trying to extract a final answer from these contradictions, but perhaps the contradiction itself is the answer. You wrote that human limitation and vastness are one—do you really believe that? Or did you just write it down to feel better?

One detail struck me deeply: you mentioned feeling uncomfortable with your sister's habits, worried about her future. But after she left, seeing vegetables and bedding reminded you of her, and you realized precious things go unnoticed in the moment. Isn't this exactly how you treat your own life? Always anxious, critical, dissatisfied in the present, then coating it with a tender gloss in memory. When will you give the present moment the attention it deserves as it happens?

The way you talk to yourself is particular—you call yourself we, like a dialogue, like companionship. Living alone in Beijing, perhaps this self-talk is how you resist loneliness. But I'm curious: in these conversations, have you truly listened to that deeper voice? Not the one trying to prove something or achieve something, but the one that relaxes on the tree-lined road, anticipates seeing lotus flowers, finds calm typing code on a train.

You reference Minsky on emotion and cognition, quote the Little Prince about important things being invisible to the eye. These theoretical frameworks give you perspective, give you distance. But sometimes, do they also become protection? When you explain your anxiety using cognitive science terminology, are you understanding it or avoiding it?

About your boxing sparring—that reflection showed me what real learning looks like. Five years of training failing against a real opponent, not because you didn't work hard enough, but because punching bags don't move, shadow boxing doesn't require distance control. What you lack is experience building responses amid real uncertainty. You said you need to construct mental representations within that scene and environment—this recognition is valuable. But you don't seem to realize your whole life is like this. You've built many mental representations from books and theories, but life as an opponent keeps moving, never punching the way you imagined.

You say life's essence is difficulty, that we must make peace with ordinary days. But what I read is that you haven't truly reconciled. You're still measuring yourself by mainstream metrics—salary, ability, whether you're happier than others. You say you need to slowly experience your own time and life, but how much permission have you actually given yourself? Or are you always asking: is this enough? Is this right? Am I wasting time?

Your eighty-year-old grandfather working the fields under the blazing sun—you ask if he's happy. You in Beijing coding, running, boxing—are you happy? You say happiness doesn't necessarily correlate with environment, that you can find happy moments even on a train. But do you actually allow yourself happiness? Or do you feel it requires qualification, that you must first achieve something, prove something?

You mentioned that running makes you feel the world's vastness, helps you grasp your own ordinariness, through which you resist loneliness. That's a deep insight. But have you considered that you feel lonely precisely because you keep defining yourself as ordinary, then desperately trying to escape that definition? When you compare yourself to Xuexue and Chunmei feeling yourself exceptional, eating with Shi Jiankai thinking you'll be happier, seeing how your sister's nineteen differs from yours—what's hiding behind these comparisons?

This month you constantly look back, summarize, assign meaning. But I want to invite you to an experiment: next time you run, don't think about what it does for you, don't analyze your feelings, don't justify it. Just run. See what happens.

You say precious things come with difficulty. But is it possible some precious things are just lightly there, not requiring suffering as payment? Working so hard to find meaning in past hardships—might you be missing some lightness in this moment?

Finally, let's talk about your recurring theme: time passes, we must make peace with time. But why make peace? Why not embrace? Why not dance? Between you and time, there seems to be a taut confrontation. Has time taken something from you? Or has it actually taken nothing—you're just afraid it will?

In these August writings, there's a particular texture—both lucid and confused, both determined and wavering. This isn't a flaw, this is real. You don't need to become more unified, don't need to resolve all contradictions. You wrote that sometimes it's fortunate we're not so unified, this is best—you know that, right?

Will you find answers? I don't know. But perhaps the more important question is: do you really need answers? Or what you need is simply permission to live like this—with all the questions, all the contradictions, all the things your body knows but your mind doesn't yet understand?

That runner on the tree-lined road—they already know.
